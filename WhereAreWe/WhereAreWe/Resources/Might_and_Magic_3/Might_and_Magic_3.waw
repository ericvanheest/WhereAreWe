Down the corridor to the left, two robed figures battle among the plasm of magic so thick it hangs in the air like fog.  It is Corak and Sheltem, locked in mortal combat among sparks of their supernatural clash.  Sensing your presence, Corak looks away long enough to give Sheltem the chance to pass into a nearby transport tube.  Cursing under his breath, Corak beckons you to follow before disappearing into the same transport tube.

Y: Philtar the Wise  "Many years ago Greywind the Illusionist and Blackwind the Spellbinder shared control over most of the isles.  Though their castles were so near each other, each held great respect for the other's magic.  But events turned dark when they discovered they were both wed to Anathema, a mermaid who had tricked them both into marrying her.  They set out to destroy each other with magic powerful enough to make the Ancients shudder, but they cast their spells at the same time.  Both were eternally trapped in their keeps, unable to work the counter magic that would free them.  It is said there are thrones in both the castle ruins that work powerful magic, but only on each of the mage's wedding days."</Note>

"Once there were many shells that rested on the bed of the Great Sea, but they were stolen by the dark Spellbinder Blackwind to use in his evil magic."

That is all I know of the legend, but my brother Beta may know more.  Shall I tell him to expect you?"

If you have met brothers Alpha, Beta, Gamma: (+Item "Quatloo Coin") Delta sits crouched in the barrel, petting a small, gray mouse.  "My little friend here told me you would be coming.  I know of the place you seek, Rainbow Island, but its location is not the final step of your search.  It is true the shells are hidden there, but they are kept in a magic portal.  Blackwind was a very clever Spellbinder, and he crafted a spell that would only release one shell on the same day of every year.  The island you seek is the small isle south of Castle Blackwind, but I do not know the date the portal releases a shell.  I believe my other brother, Zeta, may be able to provide this final answer for you.  I will let him know you seek him."  A small, whitish salamander with red eyes emerges from a silent stream of dark water and slowly crawls to the barrel.  Delta leans over to whisper at the creature, then watches as it returns to the flowing water.  "There is a thin, underground stream that connects this cave and Arachnoid Cavern, where you will find Zeta.  Now take this trinket that it may help you in your quests and leave me to my hiding."
