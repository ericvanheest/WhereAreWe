BUGS:
- Error messages like "surface map not present" are showing up behind the other windows
- If the wizard form specifies a game to launch but it can't be launched, the party and game information windows should not appear
- After a "--resetsettings" the first auto-arrange sometimes puts the windows way off to the right
- "C:\Games\Wizardry" probably shouldn't be the default in the Wizard
- Add Note -> $variables don't work in Wizardry (except 4)
- Active squares still don't always show up when first starting the program
- Clicking on an already-selected monster group in the encounter editor makes the monster list blink and lose its selected items
- hook-based shortcuts don't work well while (SVN?) DOSBox is in focus (ex: Ctrl+Shift+D -> Disarm Trap).  Works when not in focus.

OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Put the MemoryGuesses in the actual properties, not just in MainForm.Upgrade()

FEATURES:

REFACTORING:

TEST (Specific games):


TEST (All games):
X This guy might like the program: http://addictedgamewise.com/author/Admin/
X All monster and item lists
X Editing and adding backpack items
X Trash Item form
X Monster viewer form in all games
X Re-test things that now use GameStrings (Roster Editor, Game Shortcuts, AutoLaunch Maps, DOSBox Titles)
X "Drop Trash" with custom items in all games
X tabbed spell list (all games; MM1 shows Sorcerer as "Druid" and shows a blank dialog when a Robber tries to cast a spell in combat)
X Damage with average shown in multilinedescription for items in all games (especially wizardry)
X Triggers (especially on non-common-to-all-games items)
- ScanAllBlocks when memoryguess fails
- reverify that all squares are unvisited in the default maps
- Make sure DebugMonitor isn't running
- Test all quests with new questdata object
- GetAllQuests() should prevent incidental changes from constantly updating the quest list UI
- No idea why "ShowCharges" property in the Item base defaulted to "false" if there is a Use string... took that out, but need to re-test other games
- Bump version number
- "Stack charges" needs testing in other games (especially MM3-5 with its prefixes and suffixes; might need to disable the feature there)
- Hiding dashed lines in unseeen areas has been putzed with; make sure it still works in other games
- "Current character casts spell" hotkey needs serious testing (also a regression of the mm3-5 hotkeys)
- Make sure Release version actually works properly on a different machine or VM

DOCUMENTATION:

NEW GAMES:
- Eye of the Beholder 1-3
- Dungeon Master 1-2
- Ultima 1-3
- Might and Magic 6-9 (need rethinking of automap)
