DEFERRED:

- BT3: Some of the unknown bytes in the character record have values (106-111 can be 0x01) [good enough as-is]
- BT3: Monsters calling for help can leave an empty spot in the monster-HP array.  How is the game keeping track of this? [difficult to reproduce]
- BT1: See if BT1/BT2 have actual scripts like BT3 does [nah]
- Wiz4: Adding a monster type after one is killed doesn't show until combat [don't care]
- Wiz4: Changing the monster type in general seems to be spotty [don't care]
- Wiz4: Figure out the "Good" ending (CastleThirdFloor,9,15 -> Need more than just items; probably a quest bit somewhere) [not worth it]
- Wiz1: Active character during CombatOptions is sometimes zero; needs to be better [Wizardry is just not worth any extra time]
- Wiz3: Calfo seems to have a horrible success rate in the game [so what]
- Wiz1: "buyback" item at end of Boltac's list does not seem to be in memory anywhere; is it in the DSK file? [not worth it]
- Wiz1: The creation assistant often finds a spurious 17 bonus points when doing re-rolls [not worth it]
- notification window is ugly [not now]
- Test with various Windows themes   [bah]
- Scroll the pbMain when copying/moving a selection off of the panel [not writing a paint program]
- Use resources for monster lists instead of piles of .Add() calls [not now]
- Go through the various polling timers and make sure only a minimum of work is done when data hasn't changed [seem okay but didn't check thoroughly]
- Unvisited brush pattern doesn't line up at 400% zoom when redrawing only a few squares instead of the entire map [not worth fixing]
- Sometimes when opening the script window (right-click->Scripts) the byte[] argument to MM345String.SetFromBytes() is null [this is extremely sporadic]
- Somehow fiddling with the unvisited bitmap caused the border squares to be shown in white instead of gray [no idea how to reproduce this]
- Use "CompositingMode.SourceCopy" for the background/line transparency problem in RecaptureSelection() -> Mask() instead of a double copy [not simple, text behaves poorly]
- Proper error for giving up when MemoryGuesses fail and scan all is disabled (ask user to enable full scan) [current error is sufficient]
- "Play" toolbar vs. "Editing" toolbar [not enough things on the toolbar to be worth bothering for this release]
- Configurable toolbar buttons ('launch game' in particular) [not this release]
- Find/Replace for note search window [not this release]
- Set whether Shift during draw makes line straight, or only if pressed before draw starts [this isn't a paint program]
- Option to leave icon tool window hanging about [not really important, especially since next/prev icon shortcuts exist]
- Rethink the idea of creating the entire bitmap instead of just the visible area (200x200 grid at 400% zoom is nearly a gigabyte bitmap)
- "live update" of note symbol while editing [not really important]
- Expand grid via dragging grid edge [expanding the grid is not that common of an operation]
- Print [bah]
- Per-sheet axis flip and offsets [no game needs this yet]
- Item manipulation - move items to last char, etc. [not for this release]
- Backpack/Equipped item organization (show/hide weapons/armor/etc) [not for this release]
- Show map during full-screen game [not for this release]
- way to mark square/wall as "checked" [not this release]
- Send keys to DOSBox via internal hackery instead of SendMessage [complicated]
- Show monsters that can appear in random groups on the current map [not worth it]
- Make the party information window more friendly to resizing and different font sizes [lot of work]
- icons for menu items [nobody cares]
- Show/Hide during fullscreen game [not sure what I wanted here]
- Notification about low food [doesn't fit the spirit of the program; there aren't any other such notifications]
- (MM2) Find out whether a chest is trapped or not
- (MM2) Multiselect-and-edit monsters in the combat window only edits the focused monster
- (MM2) "Encased" is one status bit but somehow the 10/20/40/80 damage is stored; must find
- (MM2) Spell windows sometimes gets in a show/hide loop when waiting for town portal number [hard to replicate]
- (MM2) Party window doesn't always show "make a party" label when on the main title (gamestate isn't being understood properly) [hard to replicate]
- (MM2) Grim Reaper is listed as not being resistant to Acid, but it is.  What is that bit for?
- (MM2) Find out what upper 3 bits of outdoor map squares are
- (MM2) Show the areas that require "Pathfinder" somehow
- (MM2) If Frenzy is once per character then that must be stored somewhere (also divine intervention)
- (MM3) Find the outside/inside bit instead of guessing by map index
- (MM3) Char Creation Assistant occasionally thinks that the rolls are invalid
- Zoom in/out and then clicking on blocks still moves the scroll positions inappropriately most of the time [this is proving annoying to track down]
- Cheat: Teleport can set the location off the map [it's cheating, let them do it]
- Edit a sheet's XML directly [not worth it; there are lots of XML editors]
- Single window mode [complicated and doesn't give a lot of benefit]
- Alt+Tab behaves poorly; trying to switch back and forth between the note-search window and notepad is pesky [this is a nuisance but without single-window mode I don't know how to fix it]
- 101 vs 103 char speed order is odd [bah]
- Option for non-square grid "squares" [benefit is not worth the effort]
- Save DrawColors colors with map? [not worth it]
- Vector graphics for icons [not worth it for this release]
- Large-width dotted lines look very strange [and probably always will]
- (MM3) Time distortion doesn't always go to the same square (e.g. D-1, Surface swaps between 6,0 and 13,2) [shrug]
- Option for less spoiler-y quest info, and show/hide quest parts (map, location, hints, spoilers) (perhaps directions to the hint squares instead of outright information) [not now]
- Cheats to set/clear secondary quest goals individually [extremely unnecessary]
- Distinction between "Secondary" quest goals that are individually required vs. "one of these n goals must be completed" (icon in the listview maybe?) [making this look decent is complicated]
- Add "Size Headers and Content" as a common command to listviews (right-click on header?) [not really necessary]
- grey (or something) items in the quest tree that have uncompleted other quests as prerequisites [quest prerequisites are already at the top of the quest goals]
- Show "to hit" somewhere [accuracy modifier and weapons descriptions are probably good enough]
- Might want to show the red corners around squares where searching summons monsters [meh]
- Editing Scripts (possible a much more featured editor) [not likely]
- "Optimize" for equipment (with options like optimize for AC, for resistance, etc) [complicated and of dubious value]
- "Repair All" function (only in shops) [too complex for such a little-used function]
- Context-sensitive macros for in-game commands (cast 3-4 on {a or enter, depending on number of monsters}) [sending keys to the dosbox window is hit or miss]
- (MM1) Lock strength, trap strength, etc - are they available ? [difficult to figure out]
- (MM2) Something made the memory scanner find the wrong address; did it find a DOSBox save state? [how to reproduce?]
- (MM3) Show active squares, or is showing the monsters sufficient? [not sure what benefit it would really be]
- (MM3) "Read map from memory" is adding "o" to squares all over the place for nonobvious reasons
- (MM3) Editing a monster, then loading a previous gamestate, doesn't update the monsters in the encounter window [meh]
- (MM4) Show creature type somewhere [it's in the tooltip and not super-important]
- (BT1) Find the stats/types/damage for the Random trap squares [traps seem sufficiently random to not bother]
- (BT1) "AC Penalties" for monsters are sometimes very high (245 or so); casting FRFO increases by 1 but what does the byte really mean?  upper bits? [difficult to reproduce]
- (Wiz5) Still a few unknown bytes in the monster record (U0 might be some sort of resistance; no clue about 1 or 2)
- (Wiz5) Loading a DOSBox state while in Barter mode (from Ironose at least) leaves the shop inventory window open with trash [hard to reproduce]
