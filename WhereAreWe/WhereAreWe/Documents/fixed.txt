FIXED:
X BT3: Check spells carefully for minor differences (SP cost, range, etc.) from BT2 (and find actual ranges for spells like NUKE)
X BT2: Reset map to unexplored after playtesting
X BT2: Check multiline description and make sure all monster parts are present (like "attacks")
X BT2: Make sure monster list shows attacks properly (like BT3)
X BT2: Find monster types (for spells like HOWA) [not worth it]
X BT2: BT1/BT2 need to either make use of the Identify and Disarm labels or hide them [hidden]
X BT2: Check debug->read map (wall flags changed)
X BT2: Check the "Quest:" line in the main character window
X BT2: Add trigger targets
X Would be good to be able to move the party-window quickref somehow (especially in vertical-inventory mode)
X Try using DwmGetWindowAttribute(hwnd, DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS, &frame, sizeof(RECT)) for Win10 borders?
X The Win10 margins hack doesn't work with old-style DOSBox, because it isn't resizable.  Need more hacks.
X Wiz3: Test training assistant
X BT1: "Send Disarm Command" appears to not be working in original DOSBox [probably because no character was selected]
X Wiz5: Add trigger targets for Wiz5-specific character sheet (Regen, Poison, ID Trap, Disarm, Dispel, Swimming, Critical, Deaths)
X BT1: Add Trigger targets
X Customizable colors (for the quest list and other dialogs with colored text)
X MM3-5: Port "GetKeys()" for Spell class to MM3-5 ?  Might be complicated
X Wiz: Magic Screen and Fizzle Fields (on the encounter edit form) need to be disabled for Wiz1-3
X Doc: DOSBoxClass and DOSBoxCaption internal settings
X Doc: "Skip Introductions" feature  
X Doc: Wizardry character creation and training assistant are quite different from MM1-5 (especially the 10% and 1% chance of an extra 10 bonus points)
X Doc: Wizardry cure-all is very different (must be in the Castle)
X Doc: Double-click on party tabs to clear the delta signs (also mention the delta option)
? Doc: Wizardry will re-enable (un-"lost") the Inventory characters if they are deleted, unless they have no items [forgot what this means]
X Doc: Autocombat
X Doc: Live squares (important to not change the map book offsets when using live squares!)
X Doc: NPC monster icon (for the Wizardry hint-giver)
X Doc: "Selection" coordinates are for the grid, not the game (unlike Cursor and Party)
X Doc: Map Sections (mainly for Wizardry 5)
X Doc: LightDistance and effect on map revealing (don't forget to update the example map image to include some seen-but-unvisited squares if appropriate)
X Doc: Prefix a byte with '.' in byte string editors to use decimal value
X Doc: Manually-completable quest goals and quests via context menu
X Doc: Configurable colors for UI items (mainly quests)
X Doc: Spell list favorites (including Favorite Spell #1-#10 in the keyboard shortcuts for spells)
X Doc: Spell hotkeys probably needs updating with regard to favorite spells
X Doc: Combining item stacks (cheat-only)
X Doc: Leaving the quest window open all the time might not be the best idea (occasional out-of-memory on the treeview; constant memory updates)
X Doc: Triggers (specifically that not all items are available or work the same way in all games, e.g. "spell points" in Wizardry is unusual)
X Doc: Make sure all menu items and options dialog items have entries in the doc
X Doc: Mention the "talking" version of MM4/5 somewhere
X Doc: Actually read through the doc and see where "except Wizardry" or "except Bard's Tale" might need to be written
X Test: MM345 spell hotkeys
X Test: MM1 item-based quests
X Test: Make sure MM1 perm/temp stats are still in the right order (changed OneByteStat)
X Test: supercharacter in Wiz1
X Test: Hover over stats for Wiz2/3
X Test: Bag of Holding in Wiz1-4
X Test: Wiz1 needs full end-to-end test with new "save1.dsk" version
X Test: Wiz1/Wiz2 treasure lists (on monster page and encounter editor) (1024-byte padding was not being parsed properly)
X Test: Wiz1 werdna main quest (points in rectangles on level 10)
X Test: Roster Editor for Wiz3/4
X Test: Wiz1-3 treasure list
X Test: Wiz1 traps form
X Test: Wiz1-4's encounter editors need to ignore or hide the Magic ScreenX MM3: Sending spell keys needs complete testing for each spell (sorcerer mostly finished; need cleric and druid); some spells are out of order internally
X Wiz1: Combat is showing summoned monsters when there are none [Wizardry 1 doesn't have summoned monsters; needed MaxEncounterGroups in WizEncounterInfo]
X Wiz1: Spell list during combat shows Priest spells for Mage characters and isn't dimming unknown spells [Showing all spell types is intentional; can't replicate dimming issue]
X Wiz1: Wiz 1-4 encounter/monster editing might be writing to the wrong place now (Group 1 vs. group 0, changes to EncounterInfo starting with group 0)
X Wiz1: Add trigger targets
X Wiz1: Test custom UI colors for spell and shop items
X MM4: The "Full Speech" version has completely different memory offsets, probably needs a different MM45Memory class
X MM4: script opcode 0x3c might have something to do with speech [indeed]
X MM4: quests like "Rescue Jasper's Brother" are shown as completed until actually started (script offsets in MM5FileOffsets/MM4FileOffsets are probably wrong for speech version)
X MM4: Make utility to take offsets from MM4FileOffsets/MM5FileOffsets and find the locations of those bytes in the Full-Speech version of those files [In debug console]
X MM4: "Solve the second CastleView chest puzzle" is marked as completed when party is not in CastleView (monsters-as-script-bits may not be correct in full-voice version)
X MM4: Character sheet should not show "None" for alignment; it should be blank
X MM4: Valia's quest (MM4Map.F4Surface,9,3) shows the alacorn subtask as complete when it is not [wrong map and wrong offset]
X MM4: "Retrieve the Scroll of Insight" quest is not working [wrong offset for final quest script status]
X MM4: Hanging around on the opening title screen causes a "process re-acquired too much" error (for full speech version only?) [haven't seen it since adding the IMGMOUNT wait]
X MM4: Add trigger targets
X MM4: Check the Dwarf Mine near Fountainhead; voice version needed extra bytes in CreatePairBytes() for some reason
X MM4: Do a quick check of the quests in the non-voice version
X MM1: Make sure one-way visible walls are marked with the "bash" icon and not the half-arrow (Don't forget places like Sorpigal in the hidden areas)
X MM1: Generic "If [Any character's] [HP] [are less than] [%X] of [that characters's] [MaxHP] then change [HP] color to [Red]" style
X MM1: Update GetTriggerControl, IntValue, StringValue in CharacterInfoControl
X MM1: Add to trigger entities: alignment, currentlevel, maxlevel, agecurrent, agepermanent
X MM1: Make TriggerEntity "Name" point to the tab, not the level/sex/align/etc.
X MM1: Trigger order needs to be comprehensible (right now <30% SP = red, <60%SP = yellow behaved for listviews but not panel controls) [last one wins]
X MM1: More trigger examples: something italic; make sure all trigger targets actually work properly
X MM1: When finished, copy fixed map1.waw as built-in
X MM1: Dragadune 4 is missing some doors when using debug->replace lines and icons
X MM1: Trigger target of "resistance" doesn't do anything [created TriggerControl class]
X MM2: Add trigger targets for MM2-specific character sheet items
X MM2: Character creation increase/decrease sometimes thinks the updated values is a new roll and erases all of the stored points
X MM3: Add trigger targets for MM3-specific character sheet items (may not be any; gems/gold/food are per-party, not per-character)
X MM3: Mage/Druid spells are backwards on the spell reference (also Mage is supposed to be "Arcane")
X MM3: Shop inventories not showing when in shop
X MM3: Monster list not updating all the time; sometimes m_lastEncounterInfo.Monsters == info.Monsters even when the "m_lastEncounterInfo = info" line was never executed
X MM3: Keyboard hook isn't eating keys properly.  Options dialog can't set Shift+Home as key because it moves around in the listview
X MM3: Bashable walls should be visible if bashed (add some live squares)
X MM3: Spell window takes a few seconds to appear; not terribly annoying but suspicious, general slowness moving around in the options forms [seems to be laptop-specific]
X MM3: Go back through with a new game and make sure the live-square bash walls are correct for a new game
X MM3: Teleporting to The Arena from D2 leaves the memoryhacker main state in "LoadingMap" forever
X Bag of Holding got busted somehow [CharacterMemorySize vs. CharacterSize issue in hacker]
X B1: TradeBackpacks is not implemented
X BT2: (0x5b, 0x05) is not sufficient to determing MainState.Treasure (it happens sometimes during adventuring as well) [3AD7 seems better]
X BT2: Combat options display is not showing last two characters (e.g. defend/attack/cast/etc.)
X BT2: Find out what WZWA and VOPL actually do (and what memory locations they modify) (WZWA is a summon, VOPL is a new array, CharDamage2)
X BT2: Implement/test SetEncounterInfo()
X BT2: Bonus-on-touch is missing from encounter info
X BT2: Archmage dex 12 no equipment AC = 8 ?  Thought it should be 10 ? [had a YMCA type spell cast]
X BT2: Maze of Dread and Oscon's Fortress have the teleport targets reversed (Y/X -> X/Y)
X BT2: Use Spots to add map notes to the wilderness auto-map
X BT2: Town/Wilderness has reversed Y-axis from dungeons... map books don't support that [flip manually in hacker]
X BT2: Spinners and etc don't have the right note symbol
X BT2: PrepareCheatMenu is going to need to understand the BT1Stats/BT2Stats difference
X BT2: GetActiveSquares is unimplemented
X BT2: Spell list needs "how long it lasts" (e.g. LEVI)
X (BT2) Attacks, Critical, and Hide are the wrong offsets
X (BT2) Spellsong, Melee March, and Rhyme of Duotime have nonspecific effects
X (BT2) Number of attacks is always zero
X (BT2) Sometimes during the random treasure generation, the main window receives thousands of "WINDOWPOSCHANGING" messages, which causes focusing problems (CheckEncounters was bringing invisible form to front)
X (BT2) ShopBuyItem state stays in stack during other states (like just "Shop") and confuses the StackLocations scan.  Need to figure out where stack pointer-ish area is.
X (BT2) Check active character is correct in shop, training, town inspecting, dungeon inspecting, combat (because of stack changes)
X (BT2) Make sure all "Message [x]" notes are resolved
X (BT2) Make sure Destiny Stone level 3 has some walls in the maze when the game isn't running (live squares)
X (BT2) ReadBT123PartyInfo() is using magic number (92) instead of Games.CharacterMemorySize

X (BT2) Drop Trash
X (BT2) Character Creation
X (BT2) Training Assistant
X (BT2) See if "EquipEffects" and "Charges" are part of the BT2 item lists [yes]X (BT3) Editing an item's Identified flag or Charges writes to the wrong bytes and trashes the inventory
X (BT3) Need a way to edit Wineskin (and other item type?) flags to change the content (water, spirits, etc)
X (BT3) Editing command bytes of Message script lines doesn't let you edit the last byte properly (at least on Unterbrae 4, 1,20, line 2)
X (BT3) Opcode 0x1b is unimplemented (Forced encounter, number of groups, two bytes per group)
X (BT3) The SelectSpell/CombatSelectSpell stack bytes are off depending on a bunch of things, such as the character name.  Need a better way of determining this
X (BT3) "is in combat" is false sometimes between user inputs (e.g. holding down "d" or whatever).  Need something better than the current stack nonsense for determining this
X (BT3) Rogue abilities (Disarm Traps, Identify Chest, Identify Item, Hide in Shadows, Critical Hit) are not shown on character sheet
X (BT3) Dex 15 is +1 AC in BT3
X (BT3) The "quick state" (via memory.State1) doesn't know which character is casting a spell; is that information only in the stack? [yes]
X (BT3) "Monsters in Group" in encounter editor has a "#" column that's always '0'
X (BT3) Songs/Won/Attacks/Critical/Hide are all the same offset [Some actually are overloaded]
X (BT3) Need mainstate/inspecting char/etc
X (BT3) Use the script squares to add things to the map squares (messages, teleports, stairs, etc)
X (BT3) Spell Ref appears during character inspection (in dungeon)
X (BT3) Up/Down script (0/1) is backwards in some (most? all?) places (e.g. Map15 0,0 cmd 0x00 in-game is "down") [there is a flag bit in MapFlags]
X (BT3) Would be nice if the script editor shows the monster names instead of #1, #2, etc.
X (BT3) Need to set the "Learned" for BT3 spells that have specific locations (GILL, KINE, etc.)
X (BT3) Make sure XP/level is correct [All classes are now +400000 after level 13]
X (BT3) BT3 has actual cartography information (for the current level at any rate); use it for the visited squares
X (BT3) Portalling from Unterbrae 4 to the town by killing the boss doesn't update the map index
X (BT3) May want colors instead of (or in addition to) symbols for some square flags (HP restore, MP restore, sticky, etc.)
X (BT3) Scripts for surface maps are not correct
X (BT3) Changing a character's sex doesn't change the profile picture
X (BT3) Find out where "phase door permitted" for a map is
X (BT3) Active Squares is completely wrong (needs to show active traps, at a minimum, as the flags disappear when the trap is sprung)
X (BT3) Arboria has some unknown opcodes
X (BT3) Moving between levels still sometimes leaves the active squares wrong (e.g. from Unterbrae 4 -> Unterbrae 3) [GetInternalMapDelta didn't include previous-squares outside of current-map]
X (BT3) Identify or remove from the map notes all of the "Unknown flags" text
X (BT3) Current map is wrong (59) when in the refugee camp in the wilderness
X (BT3) Window snapping margins don't use any automatic system metrics [bah]  
X (BT3) Exception when finishing game
X (BT3) Double-click-to-cast-spell from the spell window would be extremely nice to have working somehow [home, pgdn, down]
X (BT3) combat casting spell state during fixed encounters is completely broken (e.g. WhiteTower4,4,0) [new StackStates should fix this]
X (BT3) Research the new "must start with BC 00 00 00" states for the StackStates Find()
X (BT3) StackGuesses is hopefully obsolete; verify and remove all that rubbish from BT3MemoryHacker
X (BT3) Need to differentiate "cast spell" from "use item" states
X (BT3) Check common locations of "BC 00 00 00" before searching the entire stack
X (BT3) "Award Bits" 0-63 don't seem to be actually used for awards; probably need to drop them from the awards bit editor
X (BT3) Ability to mark entire quest as completed manually as an override
X (BT3) Add "known colors" to context menu for UI elements
X (BT3) Per-map cartography editability
X (BT3) Colored stairs icons in Malefia for useless portals
X (BT3) Script bits 62 and 70 were set somewhere along the way (during the Malefia quest?); need to track those down [relate to guild elder dying after giving Werra's Shield]
X (BT3) Using an item in Ciera Brannia (at least) doesn't have the correct active character when selecting the item
X (BT3) Are items sellable?  No values for items? [sure seems so]
X (BT3) Monster list can't sort by HP or Damage [AverageDamage and AverageHP needed implementations]
X (BT3) Make sure "d" squares don't have other things in them (particularly "s")
X (BT3) show DIIL/PREC status in encounter window
X (BT3) Some bard songs are still missing stats [Minstrel Shield appears to be broken]
X (BT3) Find out where SHSH, etc. are stored and show them in game info (and encounter window, perhaps)
X (BT3) Don't forget training assistant (HP/SP per level may not be correct)
X (BT3) Strength has no effect on melee damage? (16+ only for minimal benefit like con/iq ?) [nope, seems to really do absolutely nothing]
X (BT3) "Thief Dagger" does way more damage (40-68) than its damage stat would suggest; must have some sort of other ability [was using completely wrong formula for damage dice]
X (BT3) Trap disarming is using the wrong names for BT3 traps
X (BT3) Risk/Reward is known but the actual min/max for treasure is not [manually found item ranges for all risk/rewards 0-7]
X (BT3) Item "Black Arrows" has no description [and doesn't do much either]
X (BT3) Load/Save roster file
X (BT3) Save the settings of the Drop Trash form
X (BT3) Bag of Holding is completely unimplemented
X (BT3) Make auto-combat wait until the current character has changed (or timeout) before sending a zillion attack commands
X (BT3) Monk has an AC modifier that isn't being displayed in the tooltip
X (BT3) Missile weapons seem to have wildly varying damage that isn't in the item bytes
X (BT3) "Long Bow" and throwing-only weapons show "1d2" as melee damage; that's not useful to display on the party window
X (BT3) Need to show missile weapon damage as a separate item on the party window
X (BT3) Way to stack items with charges would be nice
X (BT3) Need to hide spellbook from non-casters (Rogues, at least, use the same bits for their thief skills and looks confusing)
X (BT3) Cartography bytes are different just turning around repeatedly in a dungeon ? [was trying to set visited squares to "unseen"]
X (BT3) "Drop Trash" could use a bit of an overhaul and a "custom" setting where the user can check/uncheck specific items to keep/trash
X (BT3) Collection of selected "quick spells" would be convenient
X (BT3) Verify stats between 20-30 really have no effect?  Dex 30 is no better than Dex 18 ?? [seems so]
X (BT3) Moving between maps visits the target X,Y on the previous map (especially exiting the Festering Pit L1)
X (BT3) Hover-text in backpack thinks Titan Plate is usable by Archmages and Chronomancers (but Item List does not) [Clone busted again]
X (BT3) Grey tower level 1 is being odd with the cartography (showing one-way walls as solid instead of open when the opposite square is unvisited)
X (BT3) Need to put m_shkMM3 and m_shkMM45 into a more generic container that that all games can use spell hotkeys
X (BT3) Moving between key conflicts with F8 is not finished  - SelectNextKeyConflict
X (BT3) [after playtest] Don't forget to remove the "BC000000 in uncommon location" debug output line in BT3MemoryHacker
X (BT3) [after playtest] Make sure the manual-completion quests aren't saved as completed into the internal mapX (MM1) Some way to remember and set the current party when an inn is selected [Added to "Skip Introductions" feature]
X Some way to mark a square as "needs updates from game" (e.g. the time squares in A-1, Castle Alamar Level 2) [Added "live" flag to squares]
X "If you are Good and have removed Trebor's curse: ?" needs text (CastleSecondFloor,15,11)

X Find the bits that allow you to fight the Magic Armor, etc.
X Some squares on the map that are "dark" seem to not actually be (top row of level 5)
X Skipintroductions [seems good]
X See if any of the levels have the "not really dark" flag [no]
X Characters records appear to be slightly different - alignment/race/class/age/status [no; offset was just off by one]
X Way to move characters from Wiz1 to Wiz2 outside of the game (from roster form?) [not necessary]
X Item list
X Monster list
X Treasure list
X Missing parts of Wiz3Memory
X Game Info
X Up/Down are reversed
X Fight map
X Createsuperchar
X Editing an item shows a multiline description that has >1000 item numbers; those should be normalized
X Finish the AutoCombat() function (specifically the bCanAttack)
X Reward Levels such as 10 and 11 show "#4 to #5" and the like when they are really only a single item
X Wiz3 actually makes use of the "+x% chance to add y" to the rewards; needs to be reflected in the monster treasure description somehow
X Maps
X Replace "Maze" with "Tower" in the WAW file
X Color rooms green
X Make sure notes for the "forbidden" stairways (evil/good chars in party) have that text [Is it "any good" or "more good than evil" ?]
X Treasure screen is going to be different
X "Delay" in the game info is wrong
X Fight map is missing
X Bag of Holding should probably be removed since there is no roster
X Do something with the Black Box
X Add names for the maps (e.g. "Cosmic Cube Level 1" instead of just "Maze level x")
X Find out what the ? Spinners on level 4 actually do [really seems to be nothing; no map changes whatsoever]
X May want to remove the fight map from level 11 and the castle levels (since they don't seem to trigger combats)
X "You fell down two stories" traps need teleport coordinates
X The Hopalong Carrot supposedly does something at {Level 7: Temple of the Dreampainter} (5,8)
X Exp -> Keys, remove Dispel/ID/Disarm controls
X Encounter editor (works in combat, but not out of combat; probably want to disable out of combat editing)
X supercharacter
X maps
X items
X treasures [no treasures in wiz4]
X monsters
X Create the correct Item List, Monster List, Maps, and Treasure List *mem.gz files and test the internal vs. external data [compressed; not really worthwhile to decode]
X Need a way to always summon the maximum number of monsters (ex. 1d6 = 6) (like the Training Assistant)
X Trebor should be on the map with an "M" (and the other parties, if they have coordinates) [suspect the other parties do not]
X Werdna shouldn't show "Train!" in the quick ref
X Really might want to re-think having updatable parts of the map (room rotators and such) [MapSquareFlags.Live ?  Probably want to provide an array of squares to the hacker, not one-at-a-time]
X Need a non-debug way to modify the "Live" flag on squares (edit mode that shows a clickable highlight over top of the map sheet?)
X Live squares aren't working on 32x32 maps (e.g. B-3, Dark Warrior Keep 25,1)
X Update the live squares on various maps [Seems to be only two with movable walls]
X Update the live squares on various maps [make sure the default saved map makes sense without the game running, though - visit live maps with fresh party]
X Visit the live squares again with a fresh game to make sure the default map is correct
X Add live squares to crazy maze level
X Add live squares to MM3/4/5 for the movable walls
X Wizard Skullcap "makes tiltowait stronger" ?
X Twilight cloak "improves to-hit" ?
X The Black Box description says "Cast Kadordo" but that isn't what it does at all; need an exception for it
X The Get Out Of Jail Free description says "Cast Latumofis" but that isn't what it does at all; need an exception for it [teleport one square in a random direction if in a cage]
X Live squares need to not update when the map is not available (e.g. when speaking to the Witch, or Mron, or almost anything other than "Adventuring")
X "DAIBALO" is both bit 58 and bit 65 ? [65 is DRIP]
X Add "Victory: +Item" to the encounters that have interesting items
X Apparently the wandering Oracle has x,y coordinates?  Show on the map somewhere (new icon?)
X The party and singles bits overlap; need to not show the one bits on the other bits' edit form [both now on same form]
X If there's not going to be any "Map" Game information, that panel should not be there
X Monster 223 (ARMANIR) seems to be on level 1 and 2; is that correct? [seems to be true for several monsters]
X Add the "No" responses to (CastleThirdFloor,11,9)
X Crystal Rose makes castle guards leave you along ?  Note on map squares [doesn't seem to affect castle guard encounters]
X Add "Find" for Awards window
X Add "leave the current level" to the "Cleared When" for the Do-Gooder bits
X quests
X Apparently Kandi tells you where Trebor's Ghost is
X CastleSecondFloor,15,13 -> The ? is probably "Restored the Temple of the Dreampainter" - need to check quest bits
X CastleSecondFloor,15,11 -> need to find "remove trebor's curse" bit
X Set/Reset quest bits might actually be useful for Wiz4
X autocombat
X autostart is completely different
X Implement "GameReady" for all games
X The monster offsets aren't quite right (Lycurgus probably doesn't summon Creeping Coins) [not sure; changed to just "Summon"]
X ? at The Castle, Second Floor (15,13) and (14,11)
X Oxygen Mask game bit seems to always be true; probably not correct [don't see anything else though; not terribly important]
X Test Editing monster data for particular combat (is it writing 76 bytes as it should?) [yes]
X several maps could use the "Live" feature (especially for barriers - Castle WW, cavern under Erliquin, ...)
X At least one map has a removable wall (pull torch); use "Live squares"
X Live squares are removing the green "internal room" colorX "Dagger of Speed" doesn't show the AC -3 in the backpack description
X Option to hide unidentified items?
X "Do not lose stats" on the training assistant
X Hover over unidentified item still shows all info (also bag of holding, roster editor)
X Add character age to the creation assistant [age is set afterward]
X Wiz1 is missing some of the Wiz1Resist and Wiz1Target enums
X Saving your map file - default folder should be executable directory? ["my documents" is probably the right answer]
X The regex that matches DOSBox should be in the settings, not a constant
X Identify unknown bytes in character record (out, maze location, honors, etc)
X Add/edit/delete items
X Are there actually 5 possible groups in a combat? [no]
X CalculateExp has a "10000 * (MagicResist / 10 - 7)" line that is a hack; what is actually supposed to be making that number? (bug in ADDLONGS)
X Cheat edit AC (are there two values or not?)
X Cheat edit spellpoints
X Create Supercharacter
X Edit Monster (on encounter form)
X Edit/View spellbook

X Implement Wiz1Treasure.ShortDescription and show in the encounter window
X Item List
X Make the Encounter Square text a little less verbose (put the verbose text on the Legend instead)

X Monster List (treasure incomplete)
X Monsters are always showing up as (asleep) [using wrong column]
X Need to implement SetBackpack (amidst many other things...)
X Party Info
X Poison seems to be percentage based (also "1" seems to be the same as any other number
X Right-click to select columns on encounter form should use "Initiative" and "AC Bonus" instead of "Speed" and "Accuracy"
X Select party tab when inspecting a character
X Shopping Form
X Show poison level and saving throws
X Show regen and poison on the character record
X show something in the Resistance listview or remove it
X Show the encounter chance somewhere (from procedure CHENCOUN)
X Since the (X / Y) monster treasures always have the same gold values, they can be collapsed a little better [separated is okay]
X Spell Reference
X Trap damage is based on the maze level and the Aux values; note on the map (also % chance to avoid based on agility)
X Treasure table might be after the monster data (there are at least 21 of them)
X Use ATTK012 to show "double gold" and "better treasures" (or whatever) on the encounter form
X View vs. Edit spellbook
X warning on treasure window if someone's inventory is full? [added to conditions] 
X Add to Wizard dialog
X Creation Assistant
X switching between characters on the bag of holding doesn't show the backpack items

X Minimize either DOSBox or WAW minimizes the other (and vice-versa)
X Training Assistant
X Make sure right-click options make sense (e.g. get rid of "Set Surface Here" and "Set Lloyd's Beacon Here")
X Party/Info window says "Exit the inn" - should be "the Castle" for Wizardry
X Prox, Pos, Spd, Acc should probably all be hidden by default for Wiz1 on the encounter for (or used for something else)
X Wiz1 chars can gain more than one level at a time (maybe?); make sure the Training Assistant can handle that [can only gain one level at a time]
X HP and stat gain/loss chance are not the same as the source code; needs some empirical statistics
X Word wrap on ViewInfoForm is not good.  The "HP info" doesn't shrink well at all.
X "Fit Window" is completely borked [overrode OnSizeChanged without calling base]
X Spellcasters don't all learn spells at the same rate (e.g. Bishops learn Priest spells at level 4)
X Bag of Holding doesn't select the right character on Doussa's party ["Position" was not the right value]
X Is cure-all worth doing? (needs to be either implemented or the link removed from party window and quickref form) [yes, castle-only]
X "Silenced" is not shown anywhere
X "Maporfic" AC reduction is not shown anywhere (also it seems to be 2 and not 4 as listed in the manual)
X "Click to cast" doesn't always work in combat ["Castable" was not appropriate for the Spell class; made SpellTag instead]
X Verify if stoned party members gain XP or not [they do not]
X cure-all needs to send appropriate keys for refresh depending on the location (right now it sends 1,esc which is never right)
X Add number prefixes to inventory items
X Find the treasure index for the current chest
X Put the possible traps types for the maze level in the game info [they're for the monster, not the maze level]
X Auto-position the trap disarm splitter position closer to the treasure panel
X Some way to send the trap type to the disarm screen (that isn't just "send the right one" - user needs to choose)
X The trap type probably shouldn't actually be in the game info screen [debug only]
X Take the Wizardry-specific odd monitoring out of the QuickRefForm [debug only]
X AC and Regen don't have tooltips showing what items are affecting the value
X Treasure window [may be pointless; treasure seems to be randomly generated after chest is opened, but the trap type at least seems constant; need the type 3 sub-type though]
X Find out when characters learn spells (supposedly based on IQ/Piety as well as class?), put in the Wiz1Spell objects
X Editing monsters changes the monster list and encounter info but not the data for the fight (e.g. experience given is the original value) [oh well]
X Item.CompareTo needs help (Dagger of Speed is -3 AC; needs to be Not Comparable to most other weapons)
X Check (Maze Level 3: 13,17) and see what it actually means [it means exactly what it says]
X Quests
X Show monster's "InAudCnt" somewhere (silenced rounds)
X Make sure the wizardry spells all do what they say (e.g. Kalki seems broken - perhaps nobody was in the maze at that time though)
X "Initiative" column may be pointless (number is not generated until combat starts, and isn't valid for the next round) [eh]
X Find out exactly what "protects vs." and "purposed for" do [50% damage, double damage]
X Show critical hit chance and tooltip
X Add sleep/paralyze resistances to char record
X Add the chance for spells to work to the short spell descriptions
X Verify the damage types of spells (in particular "physical" is probably "magical" in most cases)
X Verify that swings are a minimum (either the character's built-in per-level or the weapon's, whichever is higher)
X Changing a silence value on the encounter editor doesn't reflect in the party window UI until refreshed manually
X Show "Porfic" effect somewhere (AC tooltip)
X "Edit internal cartography data" needs to be removed
X The names of the columns which right-clicking on the column headers for the quick ref window are not right for Wizardry
X Werdna's monster dialog tooltip is crashing [seems okay now]
X Port "Backpack Full" condition to the MM games? [backpack full isn't as important in those games as you can re-search to collect items]
X Spell abbreviations [not particularly important; the click-to-cast serves that purpose]
X Finish maps
X Find the other Wiz1Target types [guessed]
X Find out the numeric effects of Dilto, Mabadi, etc.
X Implement BaseHPForClass [irrelevant as HP are calculated from scratch after each level]
X Add weapon effects to MeleeDamageString
X Show "protection vs" somewhere (other than the equip list) [equip list is sufficient]
X Wiz1Character's MultiLineDescription needs wiz-specific items [not meant to be exhaustive]
X Show chance to ID items: (10 + 5*level)% to ID, (35 - 3*lev)% to touch cursed item [these do not seem correct; need empirical trials]
X Show the "dispell" chance somewhere (50 + (5 * level) - (10 * monsterlevel) - [lord ? 40 : bishop ? 20]
X Game Info [not really a lot of info]
X Find out what monster family #4 is [Midget?]
X find out what "afraid" does (for ConditionDescription) [source says nothing]X Right-click on quest goal to see how far it is from the current location (especially on surface maps)
X MM4/5 "temporary stat increase" needs to be a bit more segmented (level/resistances/primary stats at least) [added search and put stat first]
X The order of the columns in the encounter window may not be saving properly (ResizeHeadersAndContent was mucking it up)
X If DOSBox crashes on startup after the Wizard, the Party and Game forms show up at (0,0) instead of near the main window [fullscreen bumps the off-screen windows to 0,0]
X The advanced quickref form has the same "column order not being preserved" problem that the encounter window had
X LoadingMap memory address (MM3) in 32-bit SVN and old DOSBox versions
X Anchor rectangle listview needs add/remove
X Anchor rectangle listview is showing grid coordinates instead of in-game coordinates
X Change label anchors from points to rectangles (prep for MM6)
X Move/Copy/Paste labels with new anchor rectangles
X $[Equip] isn't working in MM2
X Notification to set all arcane caster's spell to "Teleport" shows as "Town Portal"
X Double-click item (weapon/armor) to show list of characters and what their current AC/damage for that type of weapon is (two-handed should show the 1h+shield, if applicable)
X (MM3) Implement MMItem.CompareTo()
X (MM45) Implement MMItem.CompareTo()
X (MM3) Helms aren't showing their AC in the item comparison window (apparently Helms are not of type Armor)
X Window snapping doesn't work if a corner of the window isn't in the snap range [needed to snap edges, not corners]
X MM3 EquipString is adding commas when only one element is present (e.g. "Dense Ring")
X (Doc) Labels form is different with the anchor rectangles now
X (Doc) Double-click/enter on backpack/equipped items for detail (Compare Item form probably needs separate entry)
X (Doc) 1-8 keys on ViewItemInfo form
X (Doc) First "better" entry is selected automatically on ViewItemInfo form
X (Doc) Mention that the Bag of Holding is not designed to prevent you from pulling silly tricks like trading items to other characters while the bag is open
X Check when Bag of Holding is closed to verify that the party inventory info is the same as it was when it was opened
X No exe/shortcut icon
X SeenSquareOpacity needs a nud in the options
X Keyboard actions for reveal seen square toggle and cycle seen square opacity
X NorthView 0,2 needs 1,3,north + 1,3,west  (and similar for other orientations and squares)
X "Indicate squares with active scripts / encounters only" moved to Encounters tab
X Keyboard actions for reveal seen square toggle and cycle seen square opacity
X Setup wizard modes need to change the seensquareopacity
X new item format string in all games
X Bag of Holding, Shop Inventory need to use FormatDescription
X Check AC for materials for accessories in mm3/4/5 again [lots of little bugs]
X Remove "show item names" and "show item information" menu items in backpack and bag of holding
X (MM3) moving between surface maps places "seen" squares where the other map's visible squares were [Added MapLoading to MemoryHacker]
X (MM3) Spell window is hidden when selecting a new spell
X (MM3) add hireling, remove hireline, use cure-all causes an exception
X Cure-all should be on advanced quickref as well
X (MM3) Monsters sometimes stay on the map when killed (until F5 refresh) [possibly fixed; intermittent]
X (MM3) Monsters aren't always appearing on the map (especially (B-4, Arachnoid Cavern: 26,0) then teleport to 27,30) [possibly fixed; intermittent]
X (MM3) MapLoaded not fully encompassing town portal time [Added grace timers]
X surface maps again [Added grace timers]
X Dying in MM2 often doesn't draw the You Are Here icon in the inn when you restart
X MM2 back and forth between maps mucks with the seen squares too
X Editing monster conditions in MM4/5 doesn't seem to do anything [fixed]
X Warn the user if unvisited .jpg files in the map book are not found (create a "do not show this again" dialog).
X Can't close encounter window any more since form.Owner change
X Default window positions need to be set again using the new WindowInfoList (only Party, GameInfo, Encounter; others can default to CenterParent)
X no right-click on keyboard list for notification selection
X no Setting for saving and loading notifications
X does not play audio notification
X does not show text notification
X no variables for text notification message (selected char, spell name, etc)
X Notification (large-ish temporary window?) when Spell Hotkeys or Cure-All (or etc.) are pressed (perhaps a list of sounds that can be set for each action in the listviw?)
X $successState, $enabledState not implemented [need success state for more functions, e.g. cureall]
X Test saving/loading keyboard settings with notifications
X Closing the spell list manually can cause access to a disposed object (TipListView) after some number of seconds. [m_tip not disposed first]
X Remove note symbol, color, unicode button, etc from "play mode" somehow (but keep party location)
X (doc) Cure-all keyboard hotkeys don't show errors
X (doc) Variables in Notifications are title-cased if the first letter is uppercase
X (doc) Audio notification files will be looked-for in the EXE directory, if the full path can't be located
X (doc) Mention clicking on 3/4/5 monsters directly on the main window (Ctrl+click for multi-select) or selecting via the encounter window
X (doc) Requires .NET 4.5 framework (not included)
X (doc) Need to actually write documentation

X (doc) Edit mode disables the "hide unvisited" while active
X (doc) Use "Notes" mode to move notes and labels around (not "Play" mode)
X (doc) explain all of the context menu items
X (doc) Mention that window positions will save/load on exit/start (user should move to comfortable positions, especially spell and shop inventories)
X (doc) What "at an inn" means for bag of holding (any square inside, or outside the front door in MM1/2, or just "in a city with an inn" forn 3/4/5)
X (doc) Explain the autoload file (saving a map while running the game sets the autoload file for that game)
X (doc) Explain the "show inaccessible" feature (note it is disabled for MM1/2)
X (doc) If DOSBox is running as Admin, WhereAreWe also must be run as Admin
X (doc) Fill and Edit mode ignore the unvisited squares, but line/block/hybrid will only draw on visible squares
X (doc) Make sure (See xxx) actually links to a part of the document
X (doc) Make two sections; "Playing" vs. "Editing" and put playing first ["Quick Start"]
X (doc) Notes on how to build the project (especially the pre-build step and perl vs. powershell)

X (doc) Where to put (and what to name) the default surface map files
X (doc) quick-start guide explaining the wizard and char creation assistant

X (doc) Make sure cross-references are all correct
X (doc) Full-justify ?
X (doc) Lots of headers have backslashes in front of them; may cause trouble
X GetDOSBoxVersion is an extreme hack; check other SVN builds [SVN-Daum is really the only contender]
X Things that use the roster file (editor, quests, bag of holding), especially with new install [all kinds of pesky bugs squashed]
X Test in non-administrator mode [surprisingly few problems, though if DOSBox is admin then WAW needs admin too]
X MM2 Middlegate is setting the cartography for the west edge of the map on startup, even with a fresh install [ShowInaccessible feature disabled for MM1/2]
X Test with large Windows font sizes (especially icons and image lists for listviews) [not nearly as bad as I feared; toolbar is odd]
X Title is missing from toolbar in 150% font mode [GetPreferredSize seems to return odd results in high DPI modes]
X If an item is "<Not Found>" in the wizard, the error message when ForceWindowed fails doesn't make a lot of sense (should be skipped if not found)
X Custom mouse cursors are smaller than the default in 150% font mode [Added double size cursors]
X Scripts with SVN/nonSVN DOSBox
X Test exchanging characters with quest window, combat window, etc. open
X Editing monsters
X Cureall
X Make sure .Log() and .MeasureTime() calls are removed (aside from the debug monitors for HP, etc.)
X Changing games with various windows open [occasionally scripts window needs refresh; others seem mostly okay]
X Right-click, "toggle visited" jumps the pbMain scroll position to 0,0 if the scrollbars are not visible [save point in CheckShowScrollbars]
X Opacity of 100 for map overlay is still showing some lines (probably from the "hide arrows and dotted lines" code) [render one extra pixel before copying]
X Surface overlays for new MM3 map file
X Opening up a pile of windows seems to have made the hacker stop working (because of SVN dosbox?) [CheckGameMemory should not have added a new event each time]
X large line widths with both keyboard and mouse [slightly odd but acceptably; set maximum line width to 4]
X quit/restart DOSBox repeatedly [needed to close the wait form and terminate the game launch thread if "launch game" is called when already active]
X Find some way to determine if drawing map updates only is really working (performance) [added checkbox to debug tab in options]
X Setting the surface map in all games [MM3-5 don't have a surface map per se]
X Shop inventories in all games [needed names for the MM1/2 towns]
X Quickref
X Default GameInfo size
X tab order for all dialogs
X MM4/5 does not implement the TradeBackpacks() function
X Windows should either have the WAW icon or no icon
X Built-in maps should be all unvisited and have no flagged quests
X Automatically set the DOSBox to windowed mode? [default option in the wizard]
X Read the DOSBox config file to set the default window positions based on whether the screen is 2x or 3x [not necessary; the auto-arrange on first run will handle it]
X Installing games to a different path [seems good]
X Get the latest version from GOG and make sure it doesn't break things [Hasn't changed since 2.0.0.41]
X Initial startup - all squares should be unvisited (MM1 still has some set)
X Default keys for fresh installations [good enough]
X Mouse/wheel default actions on new install
X Resize all resizable windows and check anchors
X Entire monster list is checked for every square drawn [the monster list is a dictionary; shouldn't be a big performance impact]
X Might be a good idea to read GameState regularly and have that data available cached instead of having party, monsters, etc. all reading it constantly [was reading every 5 ms!]
X Make sure Image and Bitmap objects are disposed
X MenuStripIgnoreFocus focuses on DevStudio when clicked from the EditLabelsForm [this seems suspiciously fixed somehow]
X Leave Ctrl+Alt+Shift in debug mode to show dirty squares? [added checkbox to debug window]
X If no squares are actually dirty in CreateImage() then the entire map is redrawn instead (can happen when dragging a note off of the map)
X Changes to map labels are marking far too many squares as dirty [SetLabelSquaresDirty was using pixels instead of mapsquares]
X Is the map redrawn repeatedly when the keyboard-mode cursor is drawn?  [no; the squares are marked as dirty, but MainForm's SetDirty() isn't called unless necessary]
X Processor usage is high (10%) when moving around the map in-game.  Doesn't appear to be because of monsters [seems better now]
X Ctrl+drag in notes mode needs some active feedback for the original label and the new note (functionally working but visually odd)
X Pressing/Releasing Ctrl while dragging label doesn't update feedback until OnMouseMove
X Labels should be hidden in unvisited squares (use Anchor property of MapLabel)
X Settings.Default.ShowMapLabels should be toggleable somewhere (also add keyboard Action)
X Add "A1" style notes around the arrows on the borders of the surface maps (use bittwiddler)
X Add labels to the towns 
X Selected label(s) become unselected when changing attributes of the label (x/y, color, etc.)
X Zooming in and out while labels are selected is causing graphical trouble when selecting other labels [label dirty rectangle needed some Math.Round()]
X Cursor is leaving graphical rubbish on the right/bottom squares again [cropped rcMinDirty improperly]
X Indicate selected notes on the map
X Map labels are using grid coordinates instead of game coordinates [no it isn't; new map books have no default offset]
X Changing the x/y position for a map label with the mouse wheel causes too many updates and makes the refresh slow
X Map labels are being drawn one square off when drawing the entire grid instead of drawing only changes [offset was wrong]
X "1:1" checkbox with scrollbars for SelectImageRectangleForm
X Add keyboard Actions for moving the selected piece of the unvisited bitmap while on the mainform (so you can see what you're doing with the map overlay instead of guessing)
X Remove the full path from the UnvisitedImage for a map if it is in the same directory as the .WAW file
X Command line options (load settings from file, etc.) [already had CLOptions; added -i for import and --resetsettings]
X Save custom unvisited brush on a per-mapbook basis [in the map book info dialog]
X Selecting a large vertical region in the SelectImageRectangleForm is slow.  horizontal is not slow. [Update timer mitigates this]
X Edit mode, select all and move shows the ghost of the previously moved selection instead of the entire map [needed m_bRecaptureSelection = true]
X Add a maximum size with kill-oldest logic to ImageCache
X Show custom bitmap over unexplored squares (e.g. the map of VARN or similar)
X Add unvisited maps for MM3,4,5
X Expand/crop need to move the MapLabels appropriately
X Move/Copy areas with map labels (EditFlags currently uses "notes" as "labels" too; might want to separate)
X Free-floating text labels at non-integer positions and variable font sizes (e.g. at (7.5,3.5, size 2: "Inn of Sorpigal" or etc.)
X Copy/Paste an area with map labels (especially to a new map with different mapbook offsets)
X Better way to move labels around (especially large labels on zoomed-out maps), probably need some form of mouse drag
X Undo needs to include map labels
X Should rotate/flip include labels? (yes)
X Map labels with alpha backgrounds are behaving oddly when lines/blocks are drawn through them (and drawing through the anchor square is oddly slow)
X Selecting block and moving them is blinking the selection marquee in and out while moving (probably the recent SuspendDrawing putzing)
X Edit box on toolstrip needs to extend to the right edge (tsEdit_ClientSizeChanged is not working properly)
X Move toolbar to a "real" one that will wrap if the window width is too small
X Add "ClearLine" to the common keys (Ctrl+U) and put them on the search fields (quests, monsters, items, etc)
X Moving the keyboard cursor on the bottom or right edge leaves graphical junk [bottom and right squares needed extra margins in CreateImage]
X Some options should probably be per-game instead of global to all games [added compromise of import/export all settings]
X miAllScriptsSetNote_Click should probably use the same code as MMScriptLine's SetNoteText [don't remember what this was; not seeing a problem currently]
X Hotkeys for note templates
X Warn user if editing roster while game is running
X Some options should probably be per-game instead of global to all games [added compromise of import/export all settings]
X miAllScriptsSetNote_Click should probably use the same code as MMScriptLine's SetNoteText [don't remember what this was; not seeing a problem currently]
X Hotkeys for note templates
X Warn user if editing roster while game is running
X per-map notes (in addition to per-square) [added to book info form]
X per-book notes (e.g. spell reference) [added to book info form]
X Go to a sheet by finding a substring in the name (/ + text ?) [Added Sheet->Goto]
X Show tooltips on subitems of full-row-select listviews (this seems complicated but would be very nice to have) [created TipListView]
X Message if the auto-acquire failed after launching DOSBox (tell user to re-acquire when ready)
X Option to draw double-width lines in keyboard mode [added to keyboard shortcuts]
X Clone a map sheet to a new map [Edit->Clone]
X Draw rectangle/circle/etc. (perhaps "draw into selected rectangle") [Fill blocks/Outline, skipping circles for now]
X "Turn half-lines into full lines" edit menu item
X More mouse wheel actions:  next/prev sheet, next/prev character
X Using the NextCharacter and PrevCharacter keyboard shortcuts brings the party window active for some reason [tabcontrol oddity; needed to disable before changing tabs]
X The second column of keyboard shortcuts doesn't work any more (in BeginEdit, the InputOption length is only 1 instead of 2 as it should be)
X Ctrl+Shift+P as the secondary keyboard shortcut for File:New seems to work, but Ctrl+O as the secondary for View:Options doesn't [ProcessKeyPreview needed some tweaks]
X Fill should respect solid non-grid lines (and go through dotted ones)
X Different mouse cursors for modes (block/fill/line/etc.) 
X Fill area
X Main grid context menu is getting big; needs organization [isn't too bad now]
X Way to hide unsolid walls until the player has passed through them (option to not draw dotted lines unless the opposite square is marked as visited)
X Map export dialog should really be modal; making sure the maps don't change in the background is error-prone
X Faster way to pick common colors for notes (right-click?)
X Colors for icons like for text (ColorMap might work well)
X Save as PNG [and ZIP for entire book]
X Rotate/flip map/selection
X Select icon from keyboard (Pad*, Direction, Enter ?) [NextIcon and PrevIcon actions]
X Quick list of icons (keyboard hotkey) [NextIcon and PrevIcon actions]
X Select icon from context menu [keyboard and wheel shortcuts are good enough for now]
X Save keyboard shortcuts on a per-game basis (or at least to external files) [added import/export to XML]
X Surround area with lines [Fill mode + Control key]
X Need something generic that looks at the square in front of the party and reveals it if it is a teleporter (possibly based on note text) ["(Teleport" or "x% chance: (Teleport"]
X "Find teleporter" code doesn't work if a teleport or jump was used to get to the teleporter initially [fixed via known squares]
X "Find teleporter" code doesn't work if the teleporter sends you back 1 square (unless you are moving backwards) [fixed via known squares]
X Unvisited squares are occasionally revealed (probably because of the teleporter code) - running still sometimes reveals the next square, load state can do it [fixed via known squares]
X Snowdrift teleporters, etc. reveal the next square forward after the teleport; may need special knowledge of those squares (LastKeypress doesn't work) [fixed via known squares]
X Find some way to not draw the windows during BringAllToFront() so that e.g. DOSBox won't flash to the front before a full-screen script window covers it [DeferWindowPos is great]
X Change default save name from "Map1.waw" [not really important]
X make lockscroll.com e-mail address and put on about box [wherearewe@lockscroll.com]
X Easier way to put a door on both sides of a wall [rotating icons with mousewheel is decent]
X Accidentally clicking "clear" when adding a new (lengthy!) note [added "Un-cancel note" which is a little hokey but gets the job done]
X Delete key to erase selection
X When using Windows 7 Themes, the "snap windows" function doesn't work quite right (with old DOSBox) [now using DwmGetWindowAttribute]
X "Change to play mode if a game is detected" next to "default mode" dropdown
X Customizable mousewheel with ctrl/shift/alt functions (rotate icons, zoom, pan, etc)
X Add something during Redraw() that shows the actual zoom level to the user as feedback
X Show the currently selected icon in the square the mouse is currently over (like a brush stamp)
X Shortcuts for select next/prev icon, line, block
X CenterControl() does bad things to the panelMain margins around pbMain if the pbMain is larger than the panel [fix ALL PROBLEMS with timers!]
X Can't edit AC in hack mode
X (Stephanie) Autolaunch MM2 doesn't set the hacker properly; requires "reset memory scanner"
X (Stephanie) Items not showing which classes they are usable by
X Should be able to close spell window manually if it came up erroneously
X Encounter window can appear if DOSBox takes too long to start; have to reset the memory hacker to fix [doesn't seem to happen now]
X DraggableListView only works on the current view; doesn't scroll when you reach the edges [fixed using timer]
X Cut/Copy/Paste/Delete don't do anything
X Indicate the mode somewhere (particularly edit/non-edit) [added text on toolbar]
X If all of the dirty squares are a single rectangle (e.g. move/copy selection), it would be better to only call CreateImage once with the entire rectangle
X Copying/moving lots of blocks (e.g. 32x32) is quite slow
X Decide what to do about using edit mode with unvisited squares hidden (edit mode probably needs to pause the memory hacker and disable invisible squares)
X Ctrl-V paste when there is a selection should paste to that rectangle, not to (0,0)
X Moving a selection off of the map doesn't delete the lines/backs/notes/icons that couldn't be moved
X Graphical feedback when moving/copying a block
X Separate context menu for edit mode with selection active
X Actions for edit flag checkboxes in options
X Selection is lost when zooming
X Moving a block does not move the outer half of a double line
X Moving/Copying blocks does not include notes or icons
X Can't copy/move a region that includes a square in the bottom row
X MapIcon objects know where they are (x,y); not sure this is appropriate (making a new icon and adding it to a square is a small nuisance) [it makes undo easier]
X Moving selected squares that includes a bottom square doesn't work (at 124x124, anyway)
X Switching maps should clear any active selection
X Pressing escape while dragging a selected block should cancel the move/copy
X Should be able to change between move/copy for a block based on Control up/down while in the process of moving the marquee
X moving a selection should display the source blocks as empty during the move [dimmed as "ghost"]
X Copy/move selection probably shouldn't copy the visited status
X If only backgrounds (or etc.) are being copied during edit mode, the feedback bitmap should only have backgrounds in it
X Dragging an edit selection around at 300% zoom leaves trash around
X "Copy only outer lines" with selection has the wrong ghost bitmap (has all of the inner lines as well)
X Moving only notes leaves non-note squares in the target area undirty (entire target area needs to be dirty regardless of items copied)
X Starting square for selection should allow a margin (clicking at 29,29 in a 32x32 square should start the selection at the next square) [decided against this]
X When copying/moving only lines, grid lines should not be included
X Pressing F5 during copy/move should redraw the selection square
X Zoom out, zoom in while keeping cursor near top, scroll to bottom, draw block -> jumps scroll to top and inadvertently draws line of blocks to new square (because of focus point?)
X select one square, push delete, deletes all outer lines in border squares
X Switching from edit mode to another mode with a selection active should clear the selection
X Changing games leaves the wrong Game Information window open
X Pressing enter on the Party window closes the form
X Game information window needs a max width during auto-arrange
X Change default background/grid line colors
X Way to assign keys/mouse to actions
X quick-select between two line types (solid/dot) [cycle line styles, cycle block styles]X Bitfields for rooms (e.g dark, anti-magic, forced encounter) [this is not necessary]
X Easier way to move the "You Are Here" icon [reading the location from the game makes this kind of pointless]
X Better layout options for a small main window (hidden menu and toolbar, better layout in the note panel for small sizes)
X Add "find text" to the keyboard shortcuts list view
X "Go to map" from the sheet organizer window
X Options to set the grid line color/pattern/width (verify that places checking for grid lines still work afterwards)
X If grid lines are going to be per-map-book then the options should be on the mapbook info dialog, not the main options dialog
X Tooltips for nonobvious settings (block/line selectors, unicode button, etc)
X Actions to toggle between last used block/line 
X Edit mode should be a toggle (back to the last mode)
X Drawing lines while the neighboring squares have not been revealed (or have only been revealed because of RevealAdjacentUnimportant) only draws half of the line
X The default window positions are useless (are they even set to anything?) [Wizard now calls AutoArrangeWindows]
X Maximize/Minimize main window puts inappropriate scroll bars [haven't seen this in some time]
X Drawing a black line from left to right sometimes leaves the grid lines visible [drawing has been completely redone]
X Changing games doesn't open a new map (need menu item to load default for current game?) [autoloading fixed]
X Search window won't go to maps after loading a different book [needed to call SetMapBook after loading a new map]
X Non-global hotkeys don't always work; depends on what main form control has the focus [seems better now]
X Can't assign Ctrl+Alt+3 as a keyboard shortcut (next shortcut assignment erases it)
X Help->About doesn't do anything and has the same shortcut as "map book info"
X Ctrl+Z from the map title textbox undoes things in the map grid instead of in the textbox
X Selecting an icon while in "play" mode should switch to another mode (otherwise the icon can't be placed) [changes to Block mode]
X Attempting to open various forms (party info, game info, training assistant, etc) with no hacker running should be more consistent (some have dialog, some caption change, some nothing)
X Pressing escape in the keyboard shortcuts find box closes the options form
X Zoom in/out should leave the center square in the center, if possible [zooming is based on cursor position now]
X Right-clicking on "block" color box selected top entry by default; that isn't the case for the "lines" color box - inconsistent [Negative ptCursor.Y was causing confusion]
X adding a row/column leaves any lines on the edge as half-edges
X Cropping leaves a ring of blank-looking squares if the outer edge is just lines (not sure how much that matters) [not sure what this meant; crop seems okay]
X Something is allowing the user to change the quick-colors via the toolbar; not sure how [haven't seen this in a long time]
X Moving the cursor around while zoomed in should scroll the view to follow the cursor
X Adding a right column or bottom row with a line on it halves the visible line
X Drawing lines from right to left or bottom to top slowly leaves pixel trash [not copying enough from the center square]
X Viewing the book info and hitting "OK" should not change the zoom level if the user didn't change the value on the form
X Zooming from 180% to 200% with the mouse in the lower right part of the map doesn't center the 200% map properly until a forced update (18x18 grid, 200% zoom fit-to-window)
X Erasing a hybrid block from the edge of the map leaves a black line, and hybrid blocks at the edge are missing a line [refactored hybrid squares]
X door-on-wall icons are kind of fat
X Selecting an icon and clicking on the grid doesn't place an icon in "Keyboard" mode [it places it in "block" mode if in "play" mode now.  keyboard is not necessarily appropriate]
X No keyboard shortcut to pick colors from dialog
X Dotted lines look odd when the left/right or top/bottom lines are slightly different widths
X New drawing function combines same-color-different-width dotted lines, but old function does not
X notes and icons not working with new 3x3 drawing function
X Wizard doesn't set the radio buttons they way the options are set when invoked manually (minimal was not checking enough settings)
X Auto-center on party is sketchy when the map size is nearly the window size (possibly because of centering a small picturebox on the panel when the panel is oversized due to scrolling)
X Error handling for save/load
X Zoom in/out with map scrolled to the bottom/right is odd [implemented CenterMap]
X After organizing sheets, clicking the map menu opens the menu at (0,0) instead of the proper menu location [Can't replace a menu during the dropdown event]
X drawing entire bitmap while zoomed in is very slow; better to mark squares as dirty as necessary for the current view
X Drawing 32x32 maps is pretty slow regardless of the zoom level even with an empty grid
X Drawing lines of blocks at 300% zoom on a 32x32 map is very slow; supposed to only be drawing the changes
X remove "IsShiftDown" from MapSheet/Draw
X Loading a map doesn't use DrawAllSquares [seems to]
X Background colors are showing through the confetti brush.. need to decide if that's better than the old way [no; back to old way]
X Releasing the mouse over the scroll bar (or other items) after a drag invokes the right-click menu [new class, PanelBlockMessages]
X Autosave could use some fleshing out (number of minutes, etc.)
X Allow custom process name and window titles for GetGameProcess()
X Complain when same keys are assigned to multiple actions
X Copy current party location to clipboard
X Choose between modes:  "Full trainer" (cheat enabled), "Maximum information" (no map or monster hiding), "Minimal information" (hide everything until explored)
X Unvisited square opacity, notes in unvisited squares, etc.
X Pick better names for the modes
X Search known locations for games; ask user to browse for them if not found
X Option to re-run the wizard
X Call the auto-arrange function after running for the first time
X Mention the colors that are ignored when checking to hide visited squares (sky, unimportant, space, others?) [added to misc options]
X Make read/write memory in the hackers simpler with MemoryBytes class
X Configurable delay waiting for game to start
X Icons for other sizes like 24x24 and 48x48 (150%, 300%)
X Mouse wheel zooming on the map should lock to 100%, 150%, 200%, etc. if close (e.g. 141% -> 150% or 158% -> 150%), so icons look nice if possible
X Alt+F when first starting the program does not open the file menu [&Finished button was stealing it]
X "Auto-position all windows" function that takes DOS Box window size and screen resolution into account
X (MM3) Check cureall and bag with active monsters nearby
X (MM3) Implement LargestBonus and LargestBonusEffect and check bag of holding columns
X (MM3) Item levels on edit form
X (MM3) add LastKeypress so that UpdateLocationFromGame can update teleporter squares
X check tooltip for cursed/equipped items in the condition string
X Update RefreshConditions() to check for location
X (MM3) Check "show nearby monsters only" [looks good]
X (MM3) Change cureall failure if monsters are nearby to "if active monsters are nearby"
X (MM3) Add "awards" link to character control
X (MM3) test bag of holding again with performance updates
X (MM3) implement IsExplored and ToggleCartography
X (MM3) Implement GetGameTimeLong()
X (MM2) Implement LargestBonus and LargestBonusEffect and check bag of holding columns
X Implement GetGameTimeLong() (if possible)
X (MM2) implement IsExplored and ToggleCartography
X (MM2) Update RefreshConditions() to check for location [1,Esc] is good almost everywhere
X If you load a new map, the active squares don't get put back until you switch maps in-game [m_lastActiveSquares needed to be null]
X Update RefreshConditions() to check for location [1,Esc is good enough for all screens]
X Should the Safest Square have an icon (that can go around a text symbol)? [can't think of anything good]
X Doing main objectives for quests without properly "starting" the quest sometimes shows the quest as finished before turning it in (quest bit never set)
X Need to stop various timers before shutting down
X Some of the options in the "Play" tab may not need to actually be there (e.g. "Read game info" checkbox vs. just selecting "None" from the current game dropdown) [done]
X Load monsters/items/etc from external files instead of internal [loading from memory directly now; if the game is modified, it should work]
X Active squares icon is not particularly clever [it is sufficient]
X "show window" should toggle show/hide for all subwindow types [except scripts; that goes to the current square whenever selected]
X Tooltips for stats on party window [done!]
X Vendor improvements - mark items as trash and sell all at vendor [sell all is getting too much into the game; drop trash implemented]
X Make sure the MapBytes and PartyBytes are not being stuffed into their member variables if the raw bytes haven't changed [GetGameInfo doesn't create a new object if the bytes are identical]
X How to get to {map:B-2, Necropolis Sewer} (1,6) ? [absolutely no idea; web says teleport, but teleport is forbidden on the map]
X Roster editor shows incorrect town when party is at a darkside inn
X Way too many monsters in inaccessible areas used as map bits; need to not show those in the encounter list
X put the encounter window name sort back to normal [changed to debug option]
X Sandro claims "L7 Item" on drop but this doesn't ever seem to happen; must be something besides that in the monster record? [L7 item drops don't seem to do anything]
X What does the "Lock Door" map command at e.g. (A-4, Ellinger's Tower Level 1: 3,8) do? [AlterMap just changes that map's wall to <x>, which differs depending on the map]
X Change symbols to be NPC names instead of Te, Hu, Sh, etc.
X Food prices, rumors, whatnot at the Inns
X "(+1 Day if you enter the xxx for any reason)"
X Add actions for all of the toggle-able settings in the options that make sense
X Check bag of holding in mm4/5 towns and inns again
X Teleporting out of range of monsters often leaves them on the map when "show only monsters in detection range" is true [was only being updated if the encounter window was open]
X Check roster editor while saved on darkside [Game seems to always use dark.cur]
X Figure out when game uses XEEN.CUR and when it uses DARK.CUR (important for bag of holding to not get corrupted) (especially check a brand new install) [Game seems to always use dark.cur]
X Default window positions should be usefully arranged, not scattered to the whims of Windows (pay attention to the display size though)
X Make all ListView headers either nonclickable or sortable
x The defaults are not to show the party or game info windows? [not any more]
X "Find" dialog take some time to show up [SizeHeadersAndContent call is actually quite slow]
X Encounter window blinks in and out during end game sequence [doesn't seem to any more]
X Way to sort bag of holding by item power (+15 better than +8, etc), element type, etc.
X Note which weapon prefixes are available for which item level somewhere (on the item edit form at least)
X Note where to get "if you have x" items in the map notes  [the searchable notes and quest list are sufficient for this]
X Check donations at temples [donate depends on day of the week for blessing, also added heal costs]
X Teleporters aren't cartography'd; make a workaround?  (e.g. C-4, Tomb of a Thousand Terrors: 3,5) [added LastKeypress so that UpdateLocationFromGame can update it]
X Needs to not attempt to show maps (and game info) while on the opening title screens [doesn't seem to be a big problem]
X Add (Map x,y) location notes to quest-related squares [the searchable notes and quest list are sufficient for this]
X The keys to send to update the party portraits after a cure-all needs to be different based on the current screen [better but not perfect]
X When entering a map, the in-game cartography should update the entire "visited" section of the map, not just the squares you manually visit (only a problem with first starting program?) [added timer]
X Timer to force a map update after 1500 ms to fix visible inaccessible areas is lame; a better fix would be nice [added 'update cartography' option]
X "Reveal Adajcent Inaccessible" only shows monsters in the inaccessible area when you first reveal it [doesn't seem to be true any more]
X Game Info window default size is not particularly useful
X Hover-over unvisited square with a monster in it shouldn't show the monster info
X Remove spurious door icons (e.g. Sandcaster 6,25)
X Check Time Distortion squares on all maps
X Display SP in the partyform quickref window if character has SP (e.g. a Ninja drank from a SP fountain)
X viewing the in-game quickref makes the quest list refresh for no reason [acting character byte]
X Configurable hotkeys for selecting character pages in the party form
X Default should be to hide the entire map, not 80% + walls [maybe; the wizard will let the user decide all of this at once]
X AC bonus from "Bless" isn't being shown anywhere
X "go to quest" from the quest list should pick from flagged or nearby if available
X The up/down stairs icons need to overlap in a better looking away (e.g. A-4, Castle Kalindra Level 2: 5,5)
X List the mirror portal keywords
X Way to mark/unmark individual cartography squares as visited
X "Available" and "accepted" both should be in "nearby" [yes]
X "Find the sixth mirror" quest involves slaying Xeen [added prequest]
X Kalindra's quest is going to the wrong locations [Seems fixed]
X Check Kappa's gold mining - some of the three-mine squares are 100-200, 0-100, 0-100 instead of the 251-350 variety
X Update the maps with valid Portal keywords (Vertigo, Nightshadow, Rivercity, Asp, Winterkill, WarZone, Alpha, Theta, Kappa, Omega, Mine 1, Mine 2, Mine 3, Mine 4, Mine 5)
X Not all portals accept all keywords
X Spell window appears while purchasing spell in a guild (may actually be useful, though) [seems like an okay accident]
X Information about external scripts (Guild spells, Training levels and costs, Shop items, etc.)
X EditBitsForm could use size saving [also EditBytesForm]
X May not want to show the monsters in the encounter list if "hide unexplored areas" is enabled
X Dwarf/Gnome again [dwarves is so stupid]
X Check AC string with Blessed [quickref needed fixing]
X "All Items" form like the monsters form
X Add FindBox to monsters form (and possibly others)
X Adapt FindBox to the quest form
X Save name/description checkboxes in settings [no idea what I was talking about]
X AddModifier needs implementation [seems done]
X MM45Item Randomize() function [seems finished]
X MM45Item MultilineDescription needs work [seems okay]
X Which items are usable by what classes is all tossed around; verify them [seems okay]
X Verify things that are similar to MM3 but might not be exact (stat bonus table, age modifiers, thievery,MaxHP,MaxSP per level/class and similar)
X Check Gnome/Dwarf .. again (might be reversed from MM3) [seems correct]
X (MM3) Still a bunch of unknown map byte items (identify them or remove them from the game info) [removed from --nodebug]
X (MM3) Check item editor again [seems good]
X (MM3) Check editing monsters again [basic editing seems okay]
X new MonsterLocations() calls AddMM3Monster() constantly.  Need to skip it if the raw bytes (minus animations) haven't changed
X If game process isn't acquired, doing things like "add item to backpack" gives no feedback as to what the problem is ["no party detected" now visible in those circumstances]
X Hireling quest(s)
X Max SP is way off (5700 vs 5472) [looks like Prayer Master for Paladins is not quite right]
X Tooltip for modified stats to show what is causing the modification
X Shop Inventory window shows last loot item when picking "inventory" in a shop before viewing items to buy [doesn't seem to any more]
X Show whether current character can use an item in the shop inventory window
X Selected monster icons on the map aren't very good, especially in 100% zoom [more cursor-style now]
X (MM1) "Find specific items" quest (like the keys and passes but for other specific useful items)
X (MM2) "Find specific items" quest (fixed-location fixed-item, like Speed Boots +3)
X Reloading a game in a different area with the script window open causes trash to be displayed in the script window [selected line was wrong]
X Temporary and Permanent stat gain quests (not just the crystals in the cavern)
X temp stat quest goals should be done based on current temp values, not just "false"
X CureAll shouldn't work if monsters are within 3 squares
X Replace hardcoded quest locations with Spots3
X Quest rewards are not complete (e.g. using the crystals for +? to stats)
X Make sure quest counts are correct
X Completed quests are not showing strikeout items
X Some quests are accepted without having any items completed
X Startup seems slower than normal [BSPlayer was causing grief]
X Editable regexes for which DOSBox title is which game
X Weapon damage may be wrong (e.g. short sword is 2d3, not 3d2) [yep, wrong]
X Mark some quests as "unofficial" in the quest list if they aren't proper in-game quests (e.g. destroy the monster generators) [meh; quests are quests]
X DOSBox search is trying full scan again [Seems okay now; new option to only try quick scans should flag this more readily in the future]
X "Set note text for this script's square" - should be debug only, perhaps [nah; the script viewer is already pretty debuggy]
X Set/Clear quest bits?  (Is that even worth trying, given how MM3 demolishes scripts?) [no; bits are editable in the game info if desired]
X (MM3) Check "Cure HP with CureAll"
X Make sure quest counts are correct
X Add Secondary skill quest (repeatable/can't complete since only two per char, but useful for the locations)
X Add Perm/Temp stat boosting quests
X Add and check the QuestBits for "learn various spells"
X Add "win black triple crown again" (and any other repeatable)
X Make sure there really are only two moon phase flags [yep]
X Forgot how to view scripts like "Custom script #249" (e.g. A-2, Castle Pinehurst, B2: 2,1) .. something about internal data [there were some bugs]
X Sometimes saving the map doesn't save the latest block color changes; no idea under what circumstances.  [GridStreamCache wasn't being updated after saving a changed map]
X Refreshing the encounter window should leave the selected monsters selected, if possible
X Make the quick reference window nonmodal/save size/etc (update with party window timer?)
X (MM345) Complete % is missing from the game info now [not worth it for these games; many unimportant squares are actually completely inaccessible]
X Check "Cure HP with CureAll"
X Make sure "Drop Trash" can't drop quest items
X Implement CreateSuperCharacter()
X Way to track "completed but doing again" quests ["Repeatable" node]
X Show proper depth instead of just a byte
X Change GameInfo to use new format
X Add the new Legend items
X Scripts are completely broken
X Replace Up/D with stair icons
X Surface map is supposed to include coordinates
X Inventory full/names/info unimplemented
X Party window switches to character 6 when quick ref screen is up in game (and when talking to Zom or Zam) [Somewhat fixed with GameState.NoActingChar]
X "In Combat" is true if you go to an exit square (magic square) and decline to exit, until you go to the character screen and exit it (difficult to reproduce) [seems to be gone]
X "Show Spell Window When Casting" doesn't seem to work until you open the spell window up once manually [doesn't seem true any more]
X refactor quests codes
X Check "Cure HP with CureAll"
X Make sure quest counts are correct
X Lord Ironfist's quests all look completed briefly while talking to him in the process of completing one of his quests [not seeing this any more]
X Somehow the hacker for the ViewPartyForm can end up being different than the one used in the MainForm (CreateSuperCharacter's IsValid is false but Teleport's IsValid is true) [possibly fixed with IMain]
X Detect when DOSBox is running a game other than the selected one and ask if the user wants to switch to that game
X Unachievable node should not be shown if there are zero quests in it
X Repeatable quests may need their own node and count at the top of the quest window (for completionists)
X Check note templates (particularly $allEncounterMonsters) [seems correct]
X Check GetMMStrings() [seems okay; don't remember the reason for checking it]
X Add the new Legend items [added some; check other games]
X Make sure "Drop Trash" can't drop quest items [ MM1Item implements Trashable property ]
X Title of encounter window during treasure search mode still says "Combat! Round x"
X Change GameInfo to use new format
X Show full/names/info isn't right (always shows all info)
X Implement CreateSuperCharacter()
X Replace "receive x" with (+Item "x")
X Replace Up/D with stair icons
X An "Exit" icon might be nice
X Selecting a location needs to leave out odd-numbered maps, as they don't actually exist
X Show proper depth instead of just a byte
X Surface map is supposed to include coordinates (don't forget MM1 maps are stored as 3 arbitrary bytes!!)
X Save size/splitters on game info window
X Getting and saving a splitter's splitposition doesn't work
X The quick-door key probably shouldn't be a global hotkey (it interferes with any menu item with a D hotkey)
X Some way to collapse/organize related quests (e.g. "Learn all of the Cleric spells") [tree view]
X Option to show completed secondary quest goals [gray and strikethrough]
X Global hotkeys for quest window, etc. [now for all menu items]
X Put alternate (non-guild) locations for spells in the quest list
X "Talk to Ambrose" quest is missing some steps
X Some quests are missing (Xenoc, mining)
X Combine "Available" with "Side" and "Main" to reduce the number of pointless tree nodes
X Way to flag quests as "paying attention to these" (new node?)
X Quest treelist blinks when updating
X MegaCredits need to be part of a quest
X right-click "flag" option for quests
X When the quest list refreshes it picks the "Active" node rather than the "Nearby" or "Flagged" node for the selected item (should keep whatever was selected before)
X Note which spells the guilds in Darkside sell
X Note the Town Portal destination squares (they are on the surface)
X Put the permanent stat increasers in the quests
X If a quest goal is "complete <other quest>" then there should be a way to jump to that treenode
X options button on quest dialog for selecting files, etc.
X Encounter window context menu needs the checkboxes put back
X Moving monsters does not update quest list locations for them
X Quest options to show rewards, giver, etc.
X Saving a window size should save the unmaximized size, if it is maximized (and probably whether it is maximized)
X Quests in the tree are in no order whatsoever [slightly more organized now]
X Add the unofficial quests (e.g. find level 7 items)
X Sub-items in "nearby" quests that aren't actually nearby should be dimmed or similar [made nearby ones bold]
X If DOSBox is minimized the autofocus doesn't work (focuses briefly on the clicked-on window such as the "find" window, and then switches to nothing)
X Put Luna and Mirabeth's quests in the "Statistic Enhancement" leaf
X Strikethrough any completed quests that are flagged
X Stop flickering in the quest list on update (especially the treeview); would be nice if there is a TopItem equivalent to keep the position the same [stopped selecting nodes repeatedly]
X "Quests for char" and "Quests for world" might need to be more .. separated [not really]
X Would be nice if the ListView for quest goals stayed where it was when it changed (not use "ensure visible" but "move to same scroll position" if possible) [TopItem to the rescue]
X character-bit quests
X The quest goals listview keeps the selected index when the selected quest is changed to a different quest, which isn't entirely appropriate
X Add Actions for all of the menu items, and change the menu hotkeys to reflect them [seems to work now]
X Add temple of bark quest to Statistics
X Awards quests?  Most of them are standard quests (but not all, e.g. Superior Intellect) [done]
X Quest list could use some expand all, collapse all, etc. functions [added expand all]
X Auto-expand a quest leaf if it only contains one or two children
X Some way to find text in the quest tree [Ctrl+F search bar]
X Some quests can be "failed" (or "uncompletable") - e.g. RetrieveAlacorn sets a character-based Award, but can only be done once, so no other character can do it [not such that it matters]
X Hover over unachievable quest locations to explain why (e.g. "The alacorn has already been returned, perhaps by a different party")
X "Where to learn" secondary skills is a little terse (e.g. "Complete Valia's quest" instead of just "F-4, Surface 9,3") [eh; there are quests for it now]
X Secondary skill quests
X Visual indicator that a quest (or goal) has no status because the data file couldn't be loaded
X Quests that have a postrequisite in the "No File" state are being filed under "Completed"
X When Alister turns into a Dragon King (D-1, Dragon Tower Level 1 6,5), the game side is wrong until the party moves or the dragon is attacked [There are a lot of WorldSide bytes]
X missing quests: find all Jewelry/Ancient Jewelry
X Some quests like "blessed by forces" and destroying the monster generators rely on "mobile objects" being removed from a map; figure out some way to know these
X Check write-time to MM3.CUR for reading quest information (using FileStream with read-only parameters seems to work) [re-reading on map change only]
X Visiting the Greek Brothers in-game doesn't seem to set the award [shrug]
X Use party bits for better quest states
X Check all of the "level ?" item squares
X Greywind's quest needs some help; all glasses must be down to remove the wall, and then up to finish the quest - look at the wall state?
X "Copy Script" only copies the main script, not any sub-scripts
X Quest window lower pane is sloppy; goals and locations should be on the same line
X Protection from elements not showing in active effects
X Script summaries for squares without display text (receive items, damage, buildings, etc)
X "Run script from another square" at least needs a "go to this square" and perhaps more needs "insert this script right here"
X Change "L" for loot that is actually nothing to "n" instead
X Find out which items are which "item level"
X Rewards for quests
X Complex quests: give orbs to kings, skulls to Kranion, artifacts to castles, shells to Athea, Arena wins, Pearls to queen, main quest line
X Setting and clearing quest bits
X "Its a Secret" map
X Normalize "party found a scroll" symbol/text
X Double-check "?" squares
X "Remove icons" on the context menu works in "play" mode, but you can't add icons back (or undo the remove - maybe remove icons doesn't set the undo? [indeed])
X Check spell short descriptions (e.g. "Create Food" creates how many?)
X Check loot squares to add number and level of items
X Check {map:} links
X Re-check loot in Temple of Moo (chest types, missing bones)
X "Kill all monsters"
X "Reset all monsters"

X Training Assistant should either do something or not be accessible
X Check duplicatable items (e.g. Sacred Silver Skull) and values of items
X Find "Donate at all temples" bits
X Temple Services
X Find the "Safest Square" (although run to might just be random)
X Something's up with the forbidden spells; C2 Surface (7,1) shows none, but C2 Surface (8,1) shows teleport/time dist/etherealize forbidden [attributes are per-quad]
X Are Asleep and Immobilized really the only monster conditions?  Silenced? (don't forget to add to monster edit form)
X Show monster conditions in encounter list and on multiline description
X Game Information (exits) [not terribly important; "Surface" doesn't exist and N/S/E/W are obvious for the surface maps]
X Check training cost/level in various towns (and max training level in a town) [cost per level is always level*level*10 Gold, town max 10/15/20/25/200)
X Cure All needs to know about anti-magic zones (if those exist), and test combat/noncombat [never seen an anti-magic zone in mm3]
X Check XP/level again, especially for robbers [robber base is 1000]
X Show magical aging somewhere
X Editing a monster's index doesn't change the animation (probably not worth fixing)
X Consider limiting (or noting that the selection is illegal, since it's cheating anyway) editing known spells by class (Paladins can't learn resurrect, etc) [they can, actually]
X Maps
X Some spells show a blank ("Learned:") as the tooltip (find which guild sells these)
X Show "to what level" an eligible character is able to train, instead of just "Train!"
X What is the Sea Shell of Serenity for? [goes to Athea]
X Throne of the Mysteries eradicates characters if they are not Ultimate Adventurers
X Ale of Advancement and etc. cause aging and set alignment to evil
X How much thievery required for chests, and how much XP they give [one value per-map]
X non-crusader text for entering castles
X Fountain in Baywatch has small % chance of raising luck? [yes]
X Check AIR/WATER/etc. teleport locations
X XP for arena battles
X Fix the legend to show MM3 instead of MM2 squares

X Not sure that ranged attacks have a multiplier like melee does [indeed not]
X rainbow island shells on particular day (brother zeta)

X Spell window still showing up briefly arrows hit targets
X Skulls in the swamp need Linguist skill to understand
X Well of rememberance
X Thievery required for locked doors (and XP given)
X Missing Castle Blackwind
X Something is giving the robber XP (picking locks?)
X "Spell Level" doesn't seem to have anything to do with level required to learn [yes, it does]
X Spell Guild list of spells
X Check pirate's treasure on Onesday (also show day of week on the party window)
X Check the Nature's Gate days
X Editing the day/year/time should set focus to that element, not just always select the time
X Add arrows and {map:} for surface squares
X Add things like the +100 SP well and +50 HP well to the active effects list [not actually an effect]
X XP required for Druid to get to level 11 is wrong (should be 768000 but showing as 576000)
X Training may take less time at different training halls (no)?  Or multiple training in one day (yes)?
X Which monsters are selected in the encounter window changes when monsters are damaged/move/etc

X Cure All
X "Set all maps cartography" needs MM5 maps
X Need Ctrl+C shortcut on Edit Bits form
X Advanced quickref could use stats and age; maybe some way to visualize the party other than a long pile of columns
X encounter window blinks on and off when in an inn with no party selected [was calling Hide() and then showing immediately]
X Verify that all of the pyramids on cloudside go to castleview [yes]
X remove the Image/Checked margin for context menus that don't need them
X Index number is not shown in backpack/equipped while "discard item?" dialog is open in game
X Put minimum sizes on all windows
X Make a base class for the CureAll functions (especially 3 and 4/5 are extremely similar) [made a common function]
X The shop inventory bytes don't belong in the game info, since there is a dialog devoted to those [moved to debug-only]
X Verify the Genie text at (E-1, Skyroad E1: 12,1) is correct [yes]
X Add the dark side locations to learn the secondary skills to the skill edit window
X Test changing class from non-spellcaster to spellcaster [seems good]
X Way to sort encounter list by proximity to the party (monsters in front of you should probably be first)
X Figure out why darkside scripts need a 0x3c000 correction [because I was using a bogus value for the pointer]
X (MM4) Test completely filling up the bag of holding (especially with only certain item types) [lots of performance updates]
X Editing the character name doesn't work
X "Active Effects" on the encounter window doesn't work (doesn't show Levitate, anyway) [moved to Game Info window for the most part]
X Editing the n/s/e/w map indices in the game info should allow all integers, not just "known" ones
X entering one of the towers (which?) goes to a map with index 100+, instead of the one I would expect [probably the MM4->MM5 transitions towers, not sure]
X MapCommand() X value is off by 16 somehow?  (F-4, Witch Tower Level 4, 10,6) [no clue; reducing the value by 16 also works; might just be a MM4 bug]
X Show quest items somewhere? [now in the game info using ByteDescriptionDelegate]]
X test "Adventurer" mode [seems to just add 3x damage from characters and a to-hit bonus; not worth dealing with separately]
X test old dosbox again (new/old game) [fixed up scripts and strings pointers]
X Make sure the 0x170 byte discrepancy is really between SVN-Daum versions and not because of the "talkie" version of MM4/5 (scripts did not have the -368 bias) [not entirely sure but testing each]
X (MM4) Old DOSBox scripts are loading from the wrong address [different constant depending on found block address.. not perfect but it works]
X Test other versions of SVN-Daum DOSBox
X Monster opacity default may need to be closer to 50% [65 seems good]
X Decide which map/party game information isn't worth showing in the list [moved pointless items to debug-only]
X See if there is a bit for "monster actively tracking party" [indeed there is; added to edit and icons]
X Option to show monsters on map only if within a configurable number of squares (e.g. within in-game detection skill range?)
X The user needs to be told if the game process is being re-acquired frequently
X See if GetMapItems() can be different per map quad [Setting or clearing a ban affects all quads, at least]
X Add the integer to the map title in the game info display
X Option to set the zoom level for all maps (or selected ones in the editor, perhaps)
X Move some GameView settings to "debug only"
X Sortable GameViewListView (need a way to put it back to the original order, though) [sorting the lists doesn't make a lot of sense]
X Need to find the proper lengths of things (Script bytes, map strings, monster positions) instead of just "read it all"
X "NumChars" is theoretically two different values - one including hirelings and one without [doesn't seem to matter for MM4/5]
X Re-acquire process after manual DOSBox reset is iffy at best [seems better now]
X Character Record: There are two "ready" spells; adventuring and combat (and they are the last bytes in the record)  [this really seems irrelevant]
X Character Record: Alignment is really "Side" (Clouds/Darkside) [this really seems irrelevant]
X Canceling the save-on-exit dialog makes reading maps (debug menu) not work [now asking to save before anything else]
X Verify spell purchase prices (especially for sorc vs. arch, etc.)
X Verify the "where learned" spell info [changed to use same function as quests]
X Implement GetDefaultMonster() (if applicable)
X Empirical test for might bonus
X "Next bonus at xx" for primary stats, to show what the next useful increase is
X SP formula tooltip
X primary stat tooltips
X (MM2) Implement GetDefaultMonster() [not particularly important for MM2]
X SP formula tooltip
X primary stat tooltips
X Empirical test for might bonus [seems the same as other stats]
X (MM1) Implement GetDefaultMonster() [not applicable; each monster is its own instance, not an index to a master list]
X SP formula tooltip
X primary stat tooltips
X Equipment effects on stats tooltip
X Age effects on stats tooltip
X Race effects on stats tooltip
X Editing a backpack item that isn't in the proper internal order doesn't work right (e.g. blank item at position 0 in memory, editing the first listview item, shows as blank in item editor)
X Show different bonus tables for different stats in charactor creation assistant; MM1 has different for at least Int/End/Mgt
X Changing a doom bug's attack type to physical crashes the game [Acy 0 and physical damage are incompatible for some reason]
X Hover-over monsters only works occasionally [seems better now]
X Hover over HP/SP/etc. to show the actual formula used for calculation (age, equipment, condition, etc)
X Hovering over a monster square while viewing a different map than the current one still shows the monster tooltip
X Watchdog timer should not display the "can't locate memory addresses in dosbox" error if it's only 1-2 seconds into the LaunchGame process [added grace counter]
X Maze level 8 is split into areas that have 8x8 sections that are adjacent to each other but not to other sections; makes a giantic map.  Might need special-casing.
X Spell list not showing in combat
X Monster Unknown[0] is "drain stat" (1-6 = strength...luck)
X Wiz5Monster's GetBytes() call is not using the byte/int unknowns properly
X Maps are often requiring a refresh to display correct Active Square icons after changing maps (again??) [The active squares delta wasn't paying attention to the Section changes]
X Add invisible barriers to the legend
X What I have listed as "water" is probably "darkness" - the pools are where you swim
X Section transitions are not correct (especially on level 4; doors are incomplete and lots of incorrect one-way walls on the map) [added "Dependent" WizWall]
X ActiveSquares are making the map center over and over
X "Shop Inventories" should probably have a different title in Wiz5 ("Purchasing Items" or similar)
X autocombat
X maps
X char creation assistant
X bag of holding
X autostart
X party
X items
X monsters
X Wiz5's GetActiveSquares() call may not need to be overridden; find the fight map
X Encounter squares are showing as active even when the encounter is complete [bits seem arbitrary]
X Collect the bits for all levels into some sort of data table for active squares [not necessary]
X Find out which bits are reset when moving between maps and which aren't
X Don't leave the (reverse bit) display on the bit editor form; make it a toggle or something
X Active bits changing isn't updating the red triangles
X Summoned monsters need to be shown somewhere (party window or encounter window)
X Should not put active square icons in the map border squares (moving between maps sometimes makes this happen) [AllInactive may have mitigated this somewhat]
X bit descriptions for level 7/8
X Put whether Litofeit, etc. are active in the game info
X Poison is not being shown on the party window
X Swim is not being shown on the party window
X "Magic Screen" needs to be shown somewhere
X AC Bonus is not showing on party window
X training assistant (Wiz5 seems to have far less chance to lose stats on level up)
X trap disarming
X treasure
X "Double Gold" needs to be based on the right value
X Treasure traps flags are wrong
X Monster lists "Lx-y" items for the treasure column aren't based on anything meaningful
X Wiz5's item invoke effects are completely different than 1-4
X Melee checkmark in Encounter window should be based on character position and weapon range
X spells (full of ?s in short descriptions)
X verify spell damage types
X Regen is not correct (or Gold Plate Mail doesn't provide regen)
X RIP is not being shown on the party window
X Cure-all (do you restore SP at the castle?  yes)
X Apparently defeating the lords teleports you somewhere; haven't managed to get that to happen yet [indeed]
X Check monster experience values [seems good]
X Editing a monster's mage level isn't writing it back to the right place in memory [off by one byte]
X quests
X Check the "learned when" for Wiz5 Spells [mage and bishop empirically identical; presuming the same for the other classes]
X Live squares on level 4 in the jigsaw bank don't always work when the map is first entered [added some more "Question" states, ignored for live updates]
X Interpret or remove all squares with [xx,xxxx,..] notes
X Make sure the saved state of maps with live squares is whatever the initial map setting is
X Way to mark a door as locked (new icon?)
X BT1: QuickRef
X BT1: Items [internal only]
X BT1: Items Form
X BT1: Cheating
X BT1: Supercharacters
X BT1: Shop Inventories
X BT1: Character Creation allows you to use one race's rolls for another race if you reroll
X BT1: Char Creation isn't showing the current stats in the listview
X BT1: Char Creation isn't implementing "use these rolls" properly (writing to wrong memory?)
X BT1: Tabbed spell list needs shortcut keys (1/2/3/4, ctrl+pgup/pgdown)
X BT1: Tabbed spell list needs to have "Spells 1" etc. replaced with Conjurer/Magician/Sorcerer/Wizard
X BT1: Tabbed spell list "find" function removes focus from the find textbox when an entry is found
X BT1: Spell list double-click doesn't work (should call OnDoubleClickSpell() but isn't)
X BT1: Spell list should show the abbreviations (e.g. "MAFL")
X BT1: Spell list isn't using the current character; always showing all spells
X BT1: Cheating: Spell book (levels) needs implementation
X BT1: Acting character isn't selecting the correct tab in the party window during combat
X BT1: Should information about Bard Spells be in the spell list? [yes]
X BT1: All spells are listed as "anywhere/anytime" but there are definitely combat-only spells; need to figure out which ones
X BT1: Char Creation doesn't update the game UI when using previous rolls [no easy way to do it; added informational message to dialog]
X BT1: "# bard songs" needs to be on the char form
X BT1: need at least one of the character creation states in the GetMainState()
X BT1: "Spellbook" on the party info screen (is it just "spell level for each class" or is there more to it?) [seems to be it]
X BT1: Spell List needs to show based on spell level for known types, not character's current class 
X BT1: Setting all monster HP to 0 doesn't end an encounter (for "kill all monsters" link in encounter editor)
X BT1: "Shop Inspecting Char" isn't focused on the party window
X BT1: Cheating: Condition needs BT-specific checkboxes
X BT1: Spell list needs "duration" column
X BT1: The tavern in Skara Brae have names; put them on the map
X BT1: Game Info (game time, ?)
X BT1: Monsters
X BT1: Monsters Form
X BT1: Spells
X BT1: Spells Form
X BT1: Maps
X BT1: Character Record
X BT1: Character Control
X BT1: Encounters
X BT1: Character Creation
X BT1: When training a character, the focused character on the party window changes randomly ["InCombat" and "PreCombat" needed to be decoupled for NoActingChar]
X BT1: Training Assistant
X BT1: Scripts [not likely]
X BT1: Cure All [no way to do that in this game]
X BT1: Quests
X BT1: Roster Editor
X BT1: Bag of Holding
X BT1: Drop Trash
X BT1: Verify the ConditionDescription strings
X BT1: Melee damage on character control is still "N/A"
X BT1: WarGloves and Pure Shield have a Damage number; is that correct?  added?  replaced? (added)
X BT1: Tooltips for stats on party form
X BT1: Need to determine bonus values for stats (e.g. dex -> lower AC) [still missing Luck tooltip; no clue what luck does]
X BT1: Resistances listview either needs something in it or to be hidden [no resistances?  no idea...]
X BT1: Show active Bard songs in game info
X BT1: Most of the spells need hard numbers in their descriptions, if possible
X BT1: Show active spells during combat (SOSH, etc.) [these are condensed into "AC Bonus" and "Damage Bonus"]
X BT1: Show characters' selected command during battle (cast/attack/defend/etc)
X BT1: Need a way to specify consistent ordering for windows (e.g. "Spell Selection always on top of Party Window")
X BT1: Generate item list from internal game data instead of in-source
X BT1: find internal monster data
X BT1: Do monsters have resistances or treasure?  Find out and unhide the encounter columns if so [seems not; treasure is part of the map?]
X BT1: Some of the ?/?? rooms may be "anti-magic" (and some may drain SP) [they actually restore SP]
X BT1: Partial-reveal map squares (SetSeen fn) based on light strength instead of just "3"
X BT1: Add GetLightDistance() to MM/Wiz games (likely just "4 or 0" depending on whether light is currently active or not)
X BT1: Add distance numbers to MAFL, CAEY, etc. spell descriptions
X BT1: Are live squares worth it?  There are some wall-to-door areas [nearly every square on the map]
X BT1: Implement GetActiveSquares()
X BT1: The store/guild/etc. on the main map are never marked as visible, because the party never is actually in those squares (added Hacker.VisitFacingSquare)
X BT1: Active Squares in Skara Brae are wrong [Skara Brae is a completely different map area in memory]
X BT1: Move the guardians from the "various monsters" quest to a specific guardian-killing quest (or to the quests they impede specifically)
X BT1: find "select song to sing" in stack (Adv. SB/sung, Combat SB/RE/dung)
X BT1: turn-order display appears/disappears during SB random encounters
X BT1: Use stack to get state properly instead of checking arbitrary points in it (don't forget SVN-old and original DOSBox!)
X BT1: There is a brief "not in combat" moment while characters are dealing damage to enemies [some more combat/precombat states]
X BT1: Spell list says "Combat Bard Spells for X, a Bard with YYY SP" -> change to "Songs" and "Songs Available" or similar
X BT1: Bring back the "disarm trap" dialog like Wizardry has (test again with new stack states) [seems to work]
X BT1: Check/Implement "SkipIntroductions"
X BT1: Apparently DOSBox and SendInput don't like the arrow keys much; this makes SkipIntroductions not work properly [no idea why; switched to "a012345e" instead]
X BT1: Show what's in the treasure box [found gold values, item range]
X BT1: Find monster AC and Condition for encounter editor (or remove those columns from the list) [removed]
X BT1: When moving through darkness (i.e. Kylearan's Tower 13,2) the focused character on the party window changes randomly [stack-based state seems to fixed this]
X BT1: Show summoned creature in party window [minimal info in game info window now] [in-game info isn't any less detailed]
X LightDistance/LOS behaves poorly when barriers are involved (e.g. MM1 Astral Plane).  Too much information for Minimal mode [hide IsSightBlocking lines in seen-only squares]
X LightDistance/LOS is odd when solid or dashed lines don't actually block vision (e.g. MM3-5 surface water) and when there are no lines for blocked vision (e.g. MM3-5 adjacent mountains)
X MM3 GameInfo is not updating when values change [Bytes property of MM3GameInfo object was not being set]
X Fix Wiz5MemoryHacker's OnReinitialized() function (if appropriate) to set NeedsReinitialize properly [always uses internal lists]
X ActiveSquares.IsActive() is called thousands of times when the map is redrawn (F5, zoom change, etc.) - needs to be particularly efficient [less than 0.5 ms to call it 1024 times]
X Check quest counts (SetQuests isn't calling AddQuest; might be broken) [indeed]
X "Short Sword" shows as usable by all, but definitely can't be used by bishop, mage, priest ... what other items might be wrong? [others seem correct]
