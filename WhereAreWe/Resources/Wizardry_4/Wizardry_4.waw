      <Note x="4" y="1" symbol="W">An ordinary solid wall in the dungeon.</Note>
      <Note x="7" y="1" symbol="E">Forced Encounter:  The party will encounter the monster(s) specified, regardless of the type of monsters otherwise assigned to the tower.  The "room" will still be cleared of its encounter flags as is the case with random encounters.</Note>
      <Note x="8" y="1" symbol="T">A teleporter to another location on the current map.</Note>
      <Note x="9" y="1" symbol="T">A teleporter to another location on the current map.  One with this background is generally to a place that constitutes "going in circles" in the game.  (If you are missing an important item, however, it may be necessary to use it.)</Note>
      <Note x="7" y="2" symbol="e">Encounter Square:  Random encounters may occur on any square, but only stepping on one of the active encounter squares will result in an encounter with a full 6-character party of Do-Gooders.
Whenever a map is loaded, several randomly-selected encounter squares will be rendered inactive.
If you have equipped "Crystal Rose" then there will be no random encounters.</Note>
      <Note x="8" y="2" symbol="s">A sign or other noninteractive information.</Note>
      <Note x="9" y="2" symbol="n">Note - Contains information about the game that has no corresponding text or action in this square.</Note>
      <Note x="1" y="3" symbol="U">A location that is generally unimportant and typically inaccessible by any means other than the Malor spell or a Teleporter trap on a chest.</Note>
      <Note x="4" y="3" symbol="!W">A passage that appears to be a wall, blocking vision, but can be walked through.  In Wizardry 4 such a wall may only be passed through while the Milwa or Lomilwa spells are active; otherwise it is an impassable solid wall.</Note>
      <Note x="7" y="3" symbol=".">Stairs going down to a lower level.</Note>
      <Note x="8" y="3" symbol=".">Stairs going up to a higher level.</Note>
      <Note x="9" y="3" symbol=".">Stairs going down to a lower level.  Stairs with this background are generally to a place that constitutes "going in circles" in the game.  (If you are missing an important item, however, it may be necessary to use them.)</Note>
      <Note x="10" y="3" symbol=".">Stairs going up to a higher level.  Stairs with this background are generally to a place that constitutes "going in circles" in the game.  (If you are missing an important item, however, it may be necessary to use them.)</Note>
      <Note x="7" y="4" symbol=".">Entering or camping in (or in some cases, leaving) a square of this type will rotate the walls around the square 90° counter-clockwise.</Note>
      <Note x="8" y="4" symbol=".">Entering or camping in (or in some cases, leaving) a square of this type will rotate the walls around the square 90° clockwise.</Note>
      <Note x="9" y="4" symbol="↺">A spinner that automatically rotates the party when activated.</Note>
      <Note x="1" y="5" symbol="D">A location in which it is too dark for the party to see the details of the area (and will cancel any Milwa/Lomilwa spells that are active).</Note>
      <Note x="4" y="5" symbol=".">One-Way: Party may pass through in the direction of the arrow but may not return (except by casting the teleportation spell "Malor")</Note>
      <Note x="7" y="5" symbol=".">Pentagram:  This is the place where Werdna may summon monsters to assist in combat.  You may generally summon higher-level monsters the closer you get to the surface, but there are some pentagrams that do not follow this trend (particularly in the Cosmic Cube, Levels 1-3)</Note>
      <Note x="8" y="5" symbol=".">Inferior Pentagram:  Pentagrams with this colored background may only be used to summon lower-level monsters than what would normally be available elsewhere on the dungeon level.  One you step onto a pentagram you must replace your summoned monsters with new ones, so be careful of these!</Note>
      <Note x="1" y="7" symbol="Ro">An internal room (cosmetic only).</Note>
      <Note x="4" y="7" symbol=".">Door: Party may pass through both directions freely.</Note>
      <Note x="1" y="9" symbol="Wa">A wall of solid rock that will instantly eradicate the party if the party becomes located in it.</Note>
      <Note x="4" y="9" symbol=".">One-way door:  Party may pass through in the direction from which the door exists, but may not return (except by casting the teleportation spell "Malor")</Note>
      <Note x="1" y="11" symbol="t">A trap square that has only negative effects.</Note>
      <Note x="4" y="11" symbol=".">Wraparound: When at the edge of a map, this indicates that the party may proceed in this direction and appear at the opposite edge.</Note>
      <Note x="4" y="13" symbol=".">Hidden Door:  This is a door that is only revealed by having the Milwa or Lomilwa spells active.  In Wizardry 4 such a door may only be passed through while those spells are active; otherwise it is an impassable solid wall.</Note>
      <Note x="4" y="15" symbol=".">Fake door:  This appears to be a door from the direction of the markings, but cannot ever be walked through.</Note>

      <Note x="10" y="10" symbol="Ga">You stand before the very gates of Hell itself!  The flames are so intense that you must shield your eyes from their infernal brilliance!  You may offer B)ribes, U)se an item or (hint!) R)un away!
Bribe: You throw your offering through the gates of Hell, only to see the gold coins melt and vaporize!  (lose all Gold)
Use "Demonic Chimes": A hideous wall of many tormented souls screams forth from the chimes, shaking the very foundations of the gates!
Use "Arabic Diary": Each gutteral word you utter from the diary takes form and hurls itself upon the gates like a battering ram!
Use "Black Candle": A brilliant light, like a small nova, issues forth from the black candle, and melts the weakened gates.  They slowly slump to the ground to form a pool of glowing metal.
The gates of hell are open!!  Do you dare to enter (Y/N) ?
N: The gates of hell slowly reassemble themselves from the pool of slag.  From far away, fro far below, you hear a chorus of demonic laughter!
Y: If you have not used "Winged Boots" and do not have "Dreampainter Ka":  You enter and fall into the abyss!  **** Aaaaarrrrrrrggggghhhhhhh ****  It burns, by the gods, it burns!!!  The fires of hell lick and scorch your flesh for what seems to be an eternity.  Finally, the torment is at an end.  You begin to sink inot oblivion, grateful to whatever god still listens to your prayers.  As your eyes close for the last time, you see a jeweled fruit hanging from a tree of liquid fire.  Then all is black.  Perhaps this is the true death, the giver of peace?  Wrong again!  (Game Over)
Otherwise, if you have "Dreampainter Ka" but have not used "Winged Boots":  Wait!  The fires of hell are not burning you!  Searching through your gear, you see that the Dreampainter's Ka is absorbing the terrific heat of the conflagration, shileding you.  As you continue to fall, you pass the tree of liquid fire, with its precious fruit hanging daintily upon a branch.  Deeper and deeper into the abyss you descend, witnessing sights which make your own evil atrocities look like the minor peccadilloes.  The sights you see become too deptraved even for you!  Your mind is twisted by the demonic visions!  It's torture, a torture worse than the fires of Hell!!  Slowly, with demented care, the gods dismember your mind!  (Game Over)
Otherwise, if you do not have "Dreampainter Ka": You plummet into Hell, and the flames lick towards you.  Slowly, your fall begins to check itself as your boots of levitation begin to arrest the powerful attraction of the infernal regions!  The heat from the flames becomes more intense, until it is almost unendurable!  Just as your fall is arrested and you begin to rise again, you are able to reach out and pluck the jeweled fruit from the tree of liquid fire!  Upward you rise, until the shattered gates of hell are once again visible through the flames and smoke!  From far below, a mocking voice calls out to you:  "You are getting warmer, but you aren't nearly hot enough for my tastes! Hahahah!"  Suddenly, a huge jet of flame washes up and over you, immolating you in an instant!  Ther is an instant of pure agony, and then you feel no more!  (Game Over)
If you already have "Holy Hand Grenade of Aunty Ock":  It is generally regarded by most sages that taking the "Holy Hand Grenade of Aunty Ock" into Hell is a bad move.  In the past, you have not been muchly impressed with the opinions of sages, but in this case they are dead on!  * * * * K a b o o o o o m * * * *   In an explosion that makes one of your finest Tiltowaits look like a wet firecracker, the potent holy relic makes avery loud noise.  It also wrecks large areas of the abyss (blowing it to Hell and gone, naturally!)  Oh yes, just in case it has not dawned upon you---back to your bier you go. (Game Over)
Otherwise: Wait!  The fires of hell are not burning and your fall is slowing down!  Searching through your gear, you see that the Dreampainter's Ka is absorbing the terrific heat and shielding you, and your boots of levitation are checking your descent.  Just as your fall is arrested and you begin to rise again, you are able to reach out and pluck the jeweled fruit from the tree of liquid fire!  Upward you rise, until you pass back through the shattered gates of Hell!  From far below, a mocking voice calls out to you: "Have you forgotten something?  Hahahahaha!"  Slowly, the gates of Hell reform from the puddle of slag.  You have obtained a jeweled fruit.  (+Item "Holy Hand Grenade of Aunty Ock")</Note>

      <Note x="10" y="1" symbol="Te">Here at the top of the ziggurat is a decrepit temple, crumbling with age and neglect.  Inside the temple is a plain altar.  Carved into the top of the altar are three depressions.
All of the depressions are empty.
You may make an offering of either G)old, an I)tem, or you may L)eave.
Gold: How about half your gold (Y/N) ?
Y:  (-50% Gold) The gold vanishes before it lands upon the altar!
Item: The item nestles in a depression.  It is as if it has become part of the altar.
If you offer Amber Dragon, Lander's Turquoise, and Bloodstone:
The temple is no longer the ruin that it was when you first found it.  Now it is bright and whole.  Power radiates.  The modest altar is resplendent with gold and jewels.  You feel the presence!
If you have already taken a sword:  Of the swords, however, the is no sign.
Otherwise: Suspended above the altar are three magical swords.  A godlike voice, coming from everywhere at once, intones...  "Take ye one of these swords as a reward for restoring unto me my sacred temple!"
Which sword will you take?  The G)reen sword, the B)lue sword or the A)mber sword?
Green:  You have obtained a green sword (+Item "East Wind Sword")
Blue: You have obtained a blue sword (+Item "West Wind Sword")
Amber: You have obtained an golden sword (+Item "Dragon's Claw")</Note>

You have found the Ron Wartow Not-Yet-Memorial wading pool, which is dedicated to the elite who jump to brilliant, logical conclusions, but alas, are wrong! Ponder this from "The Wartowliedtod" before bathing:
"Oh, will he ever return?  Will he ever return?  His fate is still unlearned!"
Will you wade (Y/N) ?
Y: If you are not Neutral: As you bathe yourself in the pool, it is as if the evil of your soul has been somewhat cleansed! (Set alignment to Neutral)
Otherwise: A pleasant dip, but nothing seems to have happened.

If you have "Holy Hand Grenade of Aunty Ock" and "Cleansing Oil" you may do the following:
1.  Equip and invoke "Holy Hand Grenade of Aunty Ock"
2.  Equip and invoke the "Cleaninsg Oil"
3.  Drop the "Holy Hand Grenade of Aunty Ock"
4.  Run to another square
If you do these steps:  4 is the number, the number is 4.  3 is too small, and 5 too large.  6 is way off.  And if you've counted, this is 1.  *** Kabalaammmmoooo ***
If you are at (18,4): You are killed

      <Note x="7" y="7" symbol="Ka">Before you looms the giant statue of the almighty Kadorto.  You are not even as tall as his little toe!  As you crane your neck backwards and look up, you see the object of your long search.  The mystical amulet is dangling from the closed fist of the statue!  "At last!" You cry, but your joy is short-lived.  There is no way that you can see to reach the amulet!  Fighting back a growing feeling of desperation, you try everything you can think of to get to the amulet.  Every spell you know is useless!  You rummage through your items, trying each in turn, hoping that one will be of aid!
If you do not have "Holy Limp Wrist": Alas, nothing seems to work.  The priests of the temple laugh at you openly.  Says one, "Oh fool, we of Kadorto let all make attempts at possessing the amulet, so sure are we that only a god could take it!  Now begone!  Try again tomorrow!
If you have "Holy Limp Wrist":  What luck!  Your holy limp wrist reliquary casts a Dialko spell!  With a feeling of triumph, you watch as the Dialko takes effect.  The hand of the statue softens and opens, freeing the amulet.  To your amazement, the Dialko spreads out.  The newly awakened god yawns and peers down at you with a look of utter contempt.  "Insect!  So you want this pretty bauble?  You have no idea what the powers of this amulet are, or what its real purpose is.  Here!  Catch it!"  Kadorto throws the amulet at you with a disdainful flip of his huge wrist!
If you do not have "Mythril Glove" equipped:  You reach out and catch the amulet!  You have it in your hand!  Wait a moment..  You have it in your hand!  Your bare hand!  * * P O O F * *   (Game Over)
If you have "Mythril Glove" equipped:  You reach out and catch the amulet!  You have it in your hand!  The mythril gauntlet protects you from its raging energies!  "Hmmmm...," intones Kadorto, "think you're clever, don't you?  Well, to keep the amulet, you will have to defeat me!  Tell me, are you a god?"  Thinking quickly, you reply, "yes!", Which seems to be the right answer.  "Then die like a god!"
If you are not wielding "Kris of Truth," "East Wind Sword," "West Wind Sword," or "Dragon's Claw":  Kadorto looks you over closely, and then declares: "you come before me armed with mere toys!  Hah!  Hah!  Hah!  Back to your bier old fool!"  (Game Over)
If you are wielding "East Wind Sword":  You draw your green sword and begin the battle.  Old forgotten powers awaken and the sword leaps to attack the pompous Kadorto.  The sword parries thunderbolt after thunderbolt while you bide your time looking for an opening...  There it is!  A quick thrust to the ankle!  Kadorto looks puzzled as a thread of green lightning snakes up his legs.  In a flash, he becomes a towering statue of green stone!  Fascinated beyond all caution, you reach out to feel the statue.  The entire statue crumbles to dust when you touch it!  The room is filled with choking dust.  You try to run outside, but you can't hold your breath long enough.  As you inhale the dust, you hear a smug laugh and Kadorto's voice whispers "gotcha!!"  You feel yourself stretching and growing rapidly.  You are very dizzy...  The room is spinning around!!  You sit down.  Ah, that feels much better!  You try to stand.  What???  You can't move!  You can see and hear, but you cannot move!  The frightened priests return in the morning and find that a miracle has happened!  A somewhat different Kadorto, all green, sits on the throne, the amulet clutched in his fist!  There you sit, playing god, aware of each slow second's passing, hoping that some greedy fool will come and try to steal the amulet, releasing you.  Centuries pass, and you realize that you got what you always wanted, the adulation and worship of many people.  How ironic...But you always have this nagging doubt..  You always wonder.. 
If you are wielding "West Wind Sword": You draw your blue sword and begin the battle.  Ancient forces are pulled into the battle, and your sword begins to glow fiercely.  Kadorto lunges downat you, but you leap nimbly aside.  His blow makes rubble of the marble floor!  Faster and faster your spinning blade weaves a deadly pattern in your hands!  You leap high onto the foot of the throne.  Kadorto is just recovering from his attack and is still bent over.  On its own volition, the sword licks out and touches Kadorto's chest!  The sword scores a critical hit!  Kadorto utters a strange gurgle, somewhat like a laugh, then with a shimmer of distorting light, he vanishes!  The priests enter and proclaim you the new god!  "What size and shape would you like, oh god?", They ask.  "My own will be sufficient!", You reply.  The priests are not overly impressed.  "How quaint," says one, glancing up at the empty throne, "at least Kadorto knew how to look like a god.  Well, we will do the best with what we have.  Wait until you see the new robes we will design for you, the ceremonies and processionals!  We will take good care of you, oh Werdna!  Your every wish is our command!"  The years pass quickly as you settle into the god business.  Using the power of the amulet, you raise huge temples, spacious retreats, and luxurious monasteries for your loyal priests.  Oh, the people grumble under the burden of their tithing.   Perhaps you are pushing things a little.  "But no," a priest whispers into your ear, "yours is the greater glory.  The people love you for it, and you must guide them."  But yet, even though you are a god, now and then, you wonder...
If you are wielding "Dragon's Claw":  You draw your dragon's claw.  It hums with anticipation.  Kadorto laughs at you, "what will you do with that?"  Actually, you are not quite sure, but it has sustained you through many trials, lending you its strength and energy.  Kadorto sends down a pillar of flame...  And the blade absorbs it!  He throws a bolt of lightning, only to see the blade cleave it in half!  You feel filled with energy!!  You let fly with a mighty blow, and your sword strikes true, slicing deep into the big toe of Kadorto!  You feel his life force flowing into you through the sword.  As it does, you begin to grow and he begins to shrink!  Finally, you are the tall god, and he is the puny mortal.  "Thank you, free at last", he croaks as he expires!  You laugh as the priests scurry around removing the remains.  Finally, they all assemble in front of you, abasing themselves and raising their voices upward in supplication:  "All pray to you, oh great god Werdna.  We rejoice the weak pacifist Kadorto has been defeated!  Take up the sacred amulet.  Lead us, oh mighty one, into glorious battle.  Make the world tremble at your every step!  Let us fill the altars with sacrifices, and the temple with gold and slaves!"  The years pass by in a blur of fire, blood and destruction.  Large areas of the world lie desolate.  Your priests bloat you with sacrifices and praise.  After this, there are other planes to conquer, other planes whose energy can feed your lust for power!  You have all your desires, all your dreams fulfilled!  But yet......Every once in along while, you wonder...
If you are wielding "Kris of Truth": You draw your dagger of clear light, and face Kadorto unafraid, for you are whole and secure in your knowledge of the tree of life.  Kadorto stops his laughing when he sees your blade.  "No, no, not that!", He cries!  The Kris blazes forth.  In its clear penetrating light, no lie or illusion can remain.  Kadorto's motions become jerky, and smoke begins to pour out of his knees and elbows.  His head pops open, and a singed high priest climbs out of a concealed control cabin.  Now you see the real truth!  Kadorto is a fake, an invention of the priests, a cunning device to perpetuate their social position and control over men!  You laugh at the ridiculous sight of a high priest with his robes smoldering.  It feels good to be alive.  You take out the amulet, and in the light of the Kris, you see it for what it really is: a dangerous trap for those unwary, a joke of the gods.  For it is neither good or evil, but fashioned out of pure chaos.  You vow to "return it" to its makers, and you are sure the kris of truth will aid you.  But that can wait for tomorrow.  Today is to be enjoyed!  Outside, into the beautiful sunshine, you walk.  Feeling at last free and alive.  You have returned to the world.  You look back at the temple for a moment, and wonder... Have you forgotten something?  You laugh, for you know that you have not.  You are master of your fate, and the winding paths of the tree of life illuminate the shape of your destiny!  * * * Congratulations * * * you have returned.  You have found the path of fulfillment!
