Talk to the elder:
If any characters are lower than level 35: The old man in the Review Board scratches his head. "Yes, you are the prophesied ones, but you have come too early. No matter."
"Beneath Skara Brae you will find one of Tarjan's devotees. Brilhasti ap Tarj is a foul Necromancer, and his life impedes my efforts to stave off disaster."
"You may enter the Catacombs under the Mad God's Temple by uttering his master's name... 'Tarjan'"
"Destroy Brilhasti ap Tarj, then return to me for your true quest."

If all characters are at least level 35 or have defeated Brilhast ap Tarj: "Welcome ye children of the prophecy. Upon your shoulders falls a great weight, for you must embark on what will be your greatest adventure ever."
"That which has laid waste to Skara Brae is an ancient evil recently released. It threatens to destroy all reality and time as it has wrought havoc on Skara Brae."
"If you cannot stop it, it will consume the universe. If you do stop it, you will be rewarded beyond all your dreams."
"Prepare thyselves, and hasten to the place of trees, for it is most like the first dimension you must sojourn in to blunt the evil."
"Aboria, the home of Valarian the bold, is reached through using powerful magic that only a Chronomancer can control."
"Bring to me Valarian's Bow and The Arrows of Life if Valarian will not return here with you."
"Yes, and be on the lookout for an ally, for you are not the first I have sent on this quest. Though your paths are different, they may cross, and you will do well together."

If you are not a Chronomancer: "I'll teach only a Chronomancer the special magic that you need to journey on your quest."

Class change to Chronomancer: Thee understands the sacrifice, dost thou not?  Thee will be stripped of all thy spell sand knowledge thereof.  Thee will be more powerful than ever before, but more vulnerable as well.  Dost thou accept this sacrifice?
Yes:  "Know this, the spell to enter Arboria is invoked by uttering ARBO and the spell to return is ENIK. Be wary, for the spells only work in one place in the land."  "There is a large grove of trees just south of Skara Brae. The spell will work there."

If you are a Chronomancer: "Hurry! Time is running out!"

If you have obtained "Valarian's Bow": The old man takes the news of Valarian's death hard, but he summons a smile to his lips and breathes deeply.
"You have done well, children, and I take well the news that Hawkslayer has survived this long. Now you are bound for a place far distant."
"It is the dimension of magic. It is known as Gelidia and if your Chronomancer is able, I will share the spells to get you there and back again."
"Bring Lanatir with you, or, if you cannot convince him to come, coax from him the Wand of Power and the Sphere of Lanatir."
(-Item "Valarian's Bow", -Item "Arrows of Life")
The old man awards each member 600000 experience points.
With a wave of his hand, the old man re-energizes all magic users.

If you are a Chronomancer: "Gelidia, the land of cold, is entered by uttering GELI and the spell to return is ECUL."  To the north is Cold Peak, your passage to Gelidia is there.

If you have obtained "Sphere of Lanatir": The old man appears visibly shaken by the news of Lanatir's death. After a long silence he stares off into space and mumbles, "Is it to be that way then?"
His eyes focus upon you again, and a grim look washes over his features. "Now you are bound for Lucencia."
I dare not hope Alliria lives, so I want you to recover the Crown of Truth and the Belt of Alliria. Beware, for she had a jealous consort, and he will protect her as best he can."
With a wave of his hand, the old man re-energizes all magic users.
(-Item "Sphere of Lanatir", -Item "Wand of Power", +600000 Exp)

If you are a Chronomancer: "Lucencia is entered by uttering LUCE and the spell to return is ILEG." To the east is a crystal spring, your passage to Lucencia is there.

If you have obtained "Belt of Alliria": The old man's look of grim determination withstands news of Alliria's death, but the information saps some of his strength.
"Quickly then, my children, to distant Kinestia!"
"You must return here with The Hammer of Wrath and Ferofist's Helm. I know Ferofist yet lives, but I cannot be sure of how long he will survive."
"Hurry, the pace quickens, and the outlook is horrible if you fail!"
With a wave of his hand, the old man re-energizes all magic users.
(-Item "Crown of Truth", -Item "Belt of Alliria", +600000 Exp)

If you are a Chronomancer: "Kinestia, the dimension of machines, is reached by casting KINE. OBRA will bring you back." "To the south-west is an old mine, you may reach Kinestia from there."

The old man's eyes narrow as you tell of Ferofist's end. "An alliance with the dark one, did he say? It is well he realized his folly in the end."
He pauses a second, and you see utter weariness send a tremor through him. "Now to Tenebrosia for all of you."
"Remember, in the land where night is day and day is night, nothing is as you know it to be. Paradox lives there - trust no one but yourselves."
"From there I require the Helm of Justice and Sceadu's Cloak."
With a wave of his hand, the old man re-energizes all magic users.
(-Item "Hammer of Wrath", -Item "Ferofist's Helm", +600000 Exp)

If you are a Chronomancer: "Tenebrosia can be reached by uttering OLUK and the spell to return is ECEA." "To the southeast is Shadow Rock, your passage to Tenebrosia is there."

If you have obtained "Sceadu's Cloak": "No!" the old man cries out, "not Sceadu as well. The dark one is utterly mad. Still," the old man smiles, "he burns the chaff while I sow the seed."
"Off with you to Tarmitia, the land of unceasing warfare. A myriad of ages meld together there, and your success depends upon your ability to adapt."
"Bring me Werra's Shield and the Strifespear."
His eyes lose their focus. "It is almost done, the circle is almost joined."
With a wave of his hand, the old man re-energizes all magic users.
(-Item "Helm of Justice", -Item "Sceadu's Cloak", +600000 Exp)

If you are a Chronomancer: "Tarmitia is entered by uttering AECE and the spell to return is KULO." "To the south is a vale, your passage to Tarmitia is there."

If you have obtained "Werra's Shield": "I know," the old man gurgles, "Werra lies dead." Blood bubbles up on his lips and joins the dark stains on the rest of his clothing. "I, too, have been slain by the Mad One."
"Gather up the prizes you have won, the special ones, those I requested. Hawkslayer has already ventured into Malefia, the land of EVIL."
"I have placed the prizes in the storage building near the entrance of Skara Brae."
"Get yourselves hence and help him. Destroy the Mad God Tarjan before he destroys all reality!!"
With those final words, the old man slumps over, and his body dissolves into a mist that a slight breeze stirs and blows away.

An old fisherman is here. He says, "For a few pieces of thy gold, I'll let thee in on a few secrets."
Shall thou give some gold to the fisherman?
No: "Well be that way!" shouts the fisherman. He eats a can of spinach and then promptly throws you out of his home. (Teleport back one square and turn around)
If you give 500 or more gold: "Here is a spell called 'Gilles Gills' that will let thee breath underwater. Just say GILL and thee can explore the life spring in the Crystal Palace."
"And don't forget to take something to carry the 'Water of Life' in, that stuff hath many healing and life giving properties!"
Who wants to learn Gilles Gills?
If character is not a spellcaster: "I cannot teach thee, thou art not a magic user."
Otherwise: The fisherman teaches you the spell. (+Spell "Gilles Gills")
If you give less than 500 gold:
"Thy should go into the forest and get some Arefolia leaves. They will let thee breath underwater for a little while."
Otherwise:
"Thy should come back when I'm not busy." He then shoos you out of his little shack. (Teleport back one square and turn around)</Note>

If "Hawkslayer" is not in the party and you have never visited this square:
Standing before you is a hearty warrior wearing battle-scarred armor and a big grin. You notice the gray shot through his black hair as he warmly welcomes you.
"Well as I live and breath!! I'd thought I'd never see you again since the time we last parted ways."
"How about us getting together again?"
No: "Well maybe you're right. I've got some sleeping to catch up on and then it's back to work."
If "Hawkslayer" is not in the party and you have visited this square before:
You come upon a sleeping man under a tree. He awakens and jumps into a fighting stance in a blink of an eye. You are taken by suprise.  "Sorry, but you can't be too careful," says the hearty fighter. "Well how about it? Shall we team up again?"
Yes:  If party is full: "It seems that you already have a full house. I get a little uncomfortable with too many people bogging the party down."
"Tell ya what, I'll wait here until you can trim your party to a more managable size. I've got some sleeping to catch up on."
Otherwise:
"It's been a long time, eh, friends? How you ever knew the answer to that riddle was 'Iceberg', I'll never know. It's good to be back with old friends." (+NPC "Hawkslayer")</Note>

"Now be off! Take heed that Tslotha Garnath can only be killed with the Nightspear, a deadly weapon hidden in the top level of Valarian's Tower."
If you have previously spoken to the King and do not have "Tslotha's Head": The King gets up from his throne, looking very angry, "Bring me Tslotha's Head!!" he screams. (Teleport back one square and turn around)

      <Note x="10" y="3" symbol="Ba">Bard's Hall: Welcome and be happy o' weary travelers!  Step to the stage and listen to my tales.
Listen to the bard:
These are the songs I know...

Dragon Song:
Dragon, dragon,/Why do you lair?/Unfurl your wings, Take to the air!/Soar high above, Far away fly,/Or is that where, You wish to die?
Hawkslayer, Hawkslayer,/Why do you ask? Killing me is a difficult task. My claws are sharp, my fangs sharper yet, And my breath flames, let us not forget.
Dragon, dragon,/Thou art quite strong. Your scales are bright and talons are long, But a duty I have and it is clear: Whatever it takes, I will drive you from here.
Hawkslayer, Hawkslayer,/Such a brief life. Have you no wish to again see your wife? Imagine her tears and grief and despair, Walk away from this fight, you have not a prayer.
Dragon, dragon,/How wise thou art./A massive beast with such a kind heart./I do wish to kiss my wife and my heir,/"Pray, fly to the mountains and await me there.
Hawkslayer, Hawkslayer,/I thought you were brave. Here I await you, deep in this cave. Come, little man, and I'll eat your brain, Then ravage Lucencia again and again.
Dragon, dragon,/Great is your heart. Massive your body, but you are not smart. The rumble you hear and the dust in the air? I've closed the cave off and trapped you in there.
Hawkslayer, Hawkslayer,/Others will come./I will wait but I will not succumb./Hero you are, and incredibly sly,/But the future I know and a hero you'll die...

Flower Ballad:
He was born with the red, red rose, Sign of his blood, was the link to the past.
In battle, he won the blue, blue rose, Blossom of his valor, his weapons were cast.
She was for him the yellow, yellow rose, Her spirit divine, his love would always last.
His pledge he made o'er the white, white rose, And she accepted it as sooth, and remained his steadfast.
So he made for her the rainbow rose, Like Alliria's beauty, a blossom unsurpassed.

Kiel's Overture: The bard smiles and says, "That one will cost thee for your bards will learn the magic of my song."
"It will cost you 60000 in gold. Who will pay?"
Pay 60000 Gold: The bard plays the song and you memorize the lines (+Song "Kiel's Overture")</Note>

If you have used "Acorn" and use a container with "Water of Life"
The acorn, saturated with the Water of Life, bursts into verdant action and a seedling rises up like Atlas, lifting the disk up and letting you pass freely. (Create east door at 1,2 and west door at 2,2)

      <Note x="10" y="2" symbol=".">The ground seems well worn here.
Cast "From Geledia" (ECUL): {map:Wilderness} (0,19)
When you enter this map, a freeze counter is set to 20.  Each step decreases this counter.  If the counter is at zero: "You are freezing!" (-6 HP)</Note>
      <Note x="6" y="4" symbol="Ou">Outpost
(Set freeze counter to 20)
The small hut holds the utter cold at bay, but the wind still whistles through small cracks, and the floor is covered with sparkling snowflakes.  Seated at a desk you see the frozen body of a man (perhaps a half-elf). The weather has not been kind to him, and he is, in effect, mummified so you cannot tell how long he has been here.  Despite that confusion about his body's condition, however, the gold wristlets and circlet he wears are styled after the fashion thought over 1000 years old in your world.  On the desk you see, beneath a light dusting of snow, a book. Its pages are covered with a bold, flowing hand that, unfortunately, turned into weakened and trembling writing.  Even a brief glance at it leaves you with the impression this was the dead man's diary.
Shall you read the Diary?
No: (Teleport back one square and turn around)
Yes:
You open the snow-covered diary and begin to read...
"The battle goes poorly, but that is as I would have predicted it. This time we have no hero like Hawkslayer to bolster our militia."
"The first invasion, as the songs sing, would have succeeded but for Lanatir's vast magics."
"How cruel it is, then, that the invaders would have struck Lanatir down in their first attack. Without hero and god, how can we prevail?"
"I agree with my brothers that none of the monsters will penetrate Lanatir's tomb, so his Sphere and the Wand of Power are safe until claimed by those capable of piercing our wards."
"It was difficult in creating those wards, powerful magic created them and only the proper spells can destroy them."
"Still, we do have hope that the foul armies swarming our verdant plains will not breech the castle and threaten Lanatir's sepulcher."
"Can it be true that I, Alendar, alone made it to this remote point?"
"A full dozen, we snuck through enemy lines and were prepared to cast a powerful spell designed to freeze our beloved home and destroy the dark ones."
"But that spell required at least four of us to cast safely. Can I do it alone? If so, at what cost? My life means nothing, but will Gelidia be saved?"
(Last entry, weak writing)
"It is done, and I die in the storm summoned to kill my foes. So cold, so numbly cold... rest well, Lanatir. Your frozen home is my grave."
There is no more.</Note>

Yes: {map:Grey Tower 1} (4,0)
Scrawled on the wall you see: Wolf to sate hunger, A hero true, but not one at all, Focus its attention, but better not be seen at all.
Between you and the doorway beyond, you see an opalescent, hulking creature with four arms and three eyes.
If you cast "Elik's Instant Wolf", "Wind Hero", "Fanskar's Force Focus" or "Kylearan's Invisibility Spell": 
The magic has been absorbed by the creature.

Yes: {map:Ice Dungeon 1} (2,8)
If you use a Lens:
&lt;character&gt; places the lens in the proper circle.
A slab of white marble fits flush into the floor. A gold plug sits in the center of it, and reeks of magic.
Light from above falls directly onto the disk from a silver disk in the ceiling.
Carved into the stone, above the gold disk, you see three overlapping circles. One arrow points from each circle toward the castle's towers.
The crystal circle is (empty/occupied).
The smokey circle is (empty/occupied).
The black circle is (empty/occupied).</Note>

Yes: {map:White Tower 1} (0,0)
Scrawled on the wall you see: Lift the veil, then counter it, false door frees, true door.
A shimmering magical curtain that looks very much like an Aurora Borealis, shifts and sways between you and a doorway.
If you cast "Levitation", "Anti-magic" or "Phase Door":
The magic has been absorbed by the curtain.

If you have not killed or cured Cyanis:
You see Cyanis huddled in a corner weeping underneath a painting of his lost love. "Why!!" he sobs in anguish.
After every eighth action the party takes: Cyanis looks at you with insanity written over his eyes. "Murderers!" he yells and lunges toward the party with anger and hatred.
Forced Encounter with Cyanis
Run away: Cyanis runs back into his corner and resumes crying. You can't help but pity him, if only you could end his madness.
Victory: You stand over the now dead body of Cyanis and wonder if what you have done was the right thing.
If you do not have "Magic Triangle": Next to the body of Cyanis is a triangle. (+Item "Magic Triangle")
Otherwise: The body of Cyanis is here. You see nothing valuable on it to steal.
If you cast "Flesh Anew", "Restoration" or "Heal All":
Cyanis gets up from the ground and wipes the tears from his eyes. "I want to thank you for ridding me of this madness that I have had to endure."
"Alliria was murdered many moons ago by something far more powerful than anything she has ever fought."
"Tarjan tortured her before she died and I was forced to watch this happen. Her screams drove me insane for I couldn't do anything to save her."
"All I ask is that you find this being and kill him for what he has done."
Cyanis sadly offers you a magic triangle. "Take this and enter the tomb of my beloved Alliria," he says, trying to hold back a tear.
"With it, a Bard can open the Black Crystal that blocks the only way in, but beware of the dangers within if you don't take precautions."</Note>

Warrior: Standing before you, blocking the hallway, you see Hawkslayer. He's younger than the last time you met, and shows none of the signs of his long adventuring career.
He stares at you and says, "The old one said I'd find allies, but I don't work with just anyone. I only want smart allies."
"Answer this riddle: Colder than myself, I cover myself with myself, and shrink so I can grow large again."
"What's the answer?"
If you do not answer "ICEBERG": "If you can't answer that simple a riddle, I don't know how you'll survive in Kinestia. I better come along and keep you safe."
Otherwise: "Glad to be in smart company. Listen, you magickers should know, magic is screwy here. Be careful."
"How about us getting together?"
No: "Well maybe you're right. I've got some sleeping to catch up on and then it's back to work."
If you have already talked with Hawkslayer: You come upon a sleeping Hawkslayer. He awakens and jumps into a fighting stance in a blink of an eye. You are taken by suprise.
"Sorry, but you can't be too careful," says Hawkslayer. "Well how about it? Shall we team up?"
Yes: (Add "Hawkslayer" to party)
If party is full:
"It seems that you already have a full house. I get a little uncomfortable with too many people bogging the party down."
"Tell ya what, I'll wait here until you can trim your party to a more managable size. I've got some sleeping to catch up on."</Note>

      <Note x="3" y="2" symbol="Fe">If you have not talked with Ferofist:
A small band of dwarves looks up and growls menacingly, but an older Dwarf, seated in the middle of their protective circle, commands them to silence.
His armor, once a masterwork by a dwarven armorer, is now holed through and through. The old dwarf is dying, but his eyes light up as he sees you.
He coughs weakly, "You have come as prophesised. You must destroy the fruits of my foolish alliance with the dark one, find the keys, and travel through my workshop into Urmech's Lair."
Ferofist collapses into a lifeless shell of a man, finally at peace. The dwarves take his body away to be buried in secret.
A dwarf says, "He scrawled this message on the wall. It may mean something or it may not."
The final dwarf leaves.
Otherwise:
Bright hand, true hand, Thine are the months of six summers.
  Sinister hand, Dark hand, Three plagues upon each finger.  In opposition, you ward the lair of my foolish death.</Note>

Seated in a scrap-metal throne you see Urmech. His iron features seem to move like flesh, and his expression is one of sorrow.
"Is this how it must end, in violence, or can we work out an accomodation?"
Yes: "Pity, I'm afraid you give me no choice then."
Forced Encounter with Urmech
Run away: "I'm glad we could avoid a confrontation." (Teleport to 6,8)
Victory: A heap of scrap metal that was once Urmech rusts on top of a scrap metal throne.
No: "Ferofist created me, despite the Gods' Pact barring further creation, and through this henious act, helped free the dark one."
"But what of me? I have done no evil except to live. I have, in turn, created others of my kind to protect me - and so I will not be all alone."
"The items you seek are in my inner sanctum. I have no need of them and they are yours to take."
"I have discovered a type of magic I will share with you, if you are willing."
"Those who wish to learn my magic should meet me at the rear of my sanctum. There I will instill this new power into your blood."
With that, Urmech leaves and enters a chamber to the south.
If you have spoken to Urmech already: A scrap metal throne is here. There is no sign of Urmech anywhere.</Note>

Urmech stands before a strange and magical machine. He says...
"This machine will instill into a Warrior, Bard, Paladin, Hunter or Monk the ability to use magic."
"You will be more than a warrior, you will be a Geomancer!!"
"But know this, you will lose some of you fighter abilities and skills but the magic you possess will more than make up for the loss."
Whom shall become a Geomancer?
If you do not select a character: "Very well, I'll be here if you change your minds." (Teleport to 6,3)
If character is not a Warrior, Bard, Paladin, Hunter or Monk: "I cannot change you, you aren't a warrior."

He smiles somewhat uneasily. "I know what you have come for, but I cannot surrender it to you."
Forced Encounter with Sceadu
Run away: Teleport to (4,13)
Victory: Sceadu, stripped of his life, cries out and collapses. "Damn you, Tarjan," he swears, then falls unconscious.
His labored chest heaves twice, then Sceadu lies utterly still.
If you have not obtained and do not have "Sceadu's Cloak": Sceadu's Cloak covers its now deceased owner. (+Item "Sceadu's Cloak")
If you have not obtained and do not have "Helm of Justice": Next to Sceadu's throne is a beautifully crafted helmet. Too bad Sceadu wasn't wearing it when you ruined his day. (+Item "Helm of Justice")
If you have defeated Sceadu:
You look in pity at the body of Sceadu, "Why did he ally himself with the dark one?" someone asks.</Note>

Only the weak light burning in the eyes, and the expression of utter horror on the face tells you something is very wrong. The statue looks like Alliria.
Here, sculpted from a black ice so frozen that it appears to be marble, you see the form of a god.
If you use "Belt of Alliria": &lt;character&gt; invokes the power of the item.
The statue fades into nothingness.  You hear a voice say, "Legions horrid and vast."</Note>

Lying sprawled on the cold marble floors you see a skeleton clad in armor. The back and breast plates are crushed as if some giant child grabbed a doll and squeezed it in rage.
Suddenly someone gasps. Clutched in one hand you see a magnificent weapon. It is a blackened steel spear with razored edges on the head and silver runes etched onto the flatter faces.
It exudes power and you instantly recognize it as Werra's Strifespear.
That means, you realize, the skeleton belongs to Hawkslayer.
It also means you are the only hope of reality...

      <Note x="12" y="15" symbol="Do">If you have used these items: "Werra's Shield" (Malefia 3 12,5), "Sceadu's Cloak" (Malefia 3 15,20), "Ferofist's Helm" (Malefia 3 21,2), "Sphere of Lanatir" (Malefia 2 9,12), "Valarian's Bow" (Malefia 2 18,16), "Belt of Alliria" (Malefia 1 3,16): Create the north door at 11,7 and the south door at 11,8
Otherwise: You see the faint outline of a door on the north wall.

Only the weak light burning in the eyes, and the expression of utter horror on the face tells you something is very wrong. The statue looks like Werra.
Here, sculpted from a black ice so frozen that it appears to be marble, you see the form of a god.
If you use "Werra's Shield": &lt;character&gt; invokes the power of the item.
The statue fades into nothingness.  You hear a voice say, "It can be stolen from the jaws of defeat. The way is open for the new generation."</Note>

      <Note x="4" y="4" symbol="Ta">If you have not defeated Lorini:
Tarjan: A dark, cloaked figure laughs. "So you think you could defeat me again, like the way you tricked me at Baron Harkyn's castle so many years ago?"
"Now I'll have my revenge on you and I'll take what should rightfully be mine!!"
"I will possess control over all space and time!!"
Tarjan waves his arms and conjures up some friends.
"Here my pretties, time for target practice."
You face
Forced Encounter with Lorini (1), High Priestess (2), Black Slayer (30), Rock Demon (30)
Run away: "I knew you could never defeat my forces of darkness!" (Teleport to 3,3)
Otherwise: Tarjan has a look of complete surprise on his face, "Most impressive, you are a hardy lot."
"Now I'll gleefully send you to the hell I came from and torment your souls for eternity."
Tarjan waves his arms and cries, "You will not live to see dawn!!"
Forced Encounter with Tarjan (1), Vampire Lord (30), Black Slayer (30), Rock Demon (30)
Victory: 
Ether: You gather around Tarjan's dead body, carefully avoiding the steaming streams of vitrolic blood burning into the stone floor, and reality slowly begins to unravel around you.
You look up and discover, where there had only been a dark rock ceiling, a brilliantly lit chimney of stone.
You slowly drift upward.
Time and space folds in upon itself and you reach a place made completely and utterly of light.
Seated in a glowing throne, a man smiles at you. Though he is youthful and handsome, you recognize him instantly as the old man who sent you upon your quest.
Beside him stands your friend, Hawkslayer.
The enthroned figure pulls out a sword and begins to speak...
"Welcome, brave heroes. You have succeeded in destroying the threat to all reality. As you know, to do this, you slipped the bonds of time, and traveled forbidden routes through that which has forever been. You pressed your struggle forward despite danger and death, and you accomplished that which the gods themselves were unable to do."..His praise washes over you like a warm ocean wave, and you feel strength infuse your body.
"In doing what you have done, you have proved youself worthy of nothing less than the ultimate reward." He closes his eyes and raises his hands. "The death of the gods tore reality asunder, but you bound it up again. The gods of old are dead, therefore I accept you as my new children. You shall be gods yourselves!"..
His eyes open again and you look upon infinity. At once you see Skara Brae restored to its former beauty. You see beyond it and the Six cities of the Plains. You see the whole world and each of its cultures, and you realize all of it is now your domain...
"And so it came to pass that eight new stars burned in the night sky. The least of these, the Companion star, was named Hawkslayer after a hero of legend. The other seven, together known as the Company of Heroes, are each named for one of the New Gods. Each night they can be seen is betokened a good night, and adventurers know these gods smile especially upon them...".-- excerpt from The Gospel of the New Gods (Chap I, Verses 5-9)...
Your party will now alter time back to the refugee camp..Who knows what new challenges await you in the future!</Note>
