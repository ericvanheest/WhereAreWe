      <Note x="6" y="1" color="FF000000" symbol="n">Note - Contains information about the game that has no corresponding text or action in this square.</Note>
      <Note x="7" y="1" color="FF000000" symbol="T">A teleporter to another location on the current map.</Note>

      <Note x="8" y="2" symbol="xp">A square that provides XP (usually once based on a particular in-game flag bit which is set when the XP is received) when the party enters it.</Note>
      <Note x="1" y="3" color="FF000000" symbol="U">A location that is generally unimportant and typically inaccessible without cheating.  Some actions (e.g. pressing a button) may change these squares to accessible and vice-versa.</Note>
      <Note x="3" y="3" color="FF000000" symbol="!W">Secret Door: A passage that appears to be a wall, blocking vision, but can be walked through.  Monsters generally can not pass through these.</Note>

      <Note x="1" y="5" symbol="xp">A location in which it is possible to gain Experience without combat.  Generally an XP reward will be given only the first time an action is taken (or a square is entered).

      <Note x="3" y="5" color="FF000000" symbol=".">Open Door: May be passed through.  Doors often require manipulation of environment objects (buttons, levers, floor plates) to open or close.  Some doors may be forced open by clicking on them.</Note>

Talk: The dwarf gasps out, "Drow... save the king... prince is gone..." He falls unconscious.
Tend his wounds: Having regained his strength, the dwarf thanks you. "I thought that I had met my death at the blade of that drow. In battle our king was grievously wounded, and the young prince kidnapped. I tried to stop the drow, but alas, I was overcome..    "You have saved me from death! I wish there was some way to thank you, but I have nothing. I am alone, separated from my people during the battle. May I join you, so that together we can search for my people?" 
No: "I thank you, but I will find my own way back. A warning: Beware the stone doorways set into these walls. They are portal entrances, which become active with the right key. My party encamped near such a portal, and was easily ambushed." Thanking you again, the dwarf wanders off.
Yes: As Taghor joins your party he says, "During the battle, I chased my enemy up a staircase, to this level. My people should be on the level just below us." (Taghor joins party)

Otherwise: "A weary Dwarven cleric greets you.  "Yes, how can I help you?"
Heal party: (Restore 57 HP total starting with the first character)
If the party has used the cleric's services this day:  An exhuasted Dwarven cleric rubs his eyes and tells you to come back after he has rested.
Resurrect dead: (Summon character depending on bones selected)
Anya: Anya looks about in confusion. "My companions and I died fighting the minions of Xanathar. I expected to awaken in the afterlife, not in the dungeons where I had fallen." .    "I do not like this place, but I am a fighter. I would join you in your hunt for Xanathar so that I may avenge the deaths of my companions." 
No: "Then, our paths must separate. I will exact my own revenge upon Xanathar. May the luck of the Hunter guide you." 
Yes: (Anya joins party)
Beohram: Beohram looks down in anger. "Resurrected! Then my mission has failed. I am Beohram of the City Watch. When the rumors of Xanathar first arose, I went down alone to investigate. I see that they were more than rumors. Will you allow me to join you and finish my quest against the evil which plagues Waterdeep?" 
No: "I regret that I cannot accompany you to meet the threat. That decision is, of course, yours. I shall attempt to find my own route to the surface, where I will sing of your brave deeds in the face of certain doom." 
Yes: (Beohram joins party)
Kirath: Kirath looks about, annoyed. "You mean I was dead? Hmph. Now you probably think I owe you for resurrecting me. I care nothing for your commission from the Lords of Waterdeep, but we seem to be heading down the same path..    "I am Kirath, the greatest wizard of the Realms. I seek the special magics that Xanathar is alleged to possess. Perhaps we can help each other. At least, you might benefit from my talents and power." 
No: "Have it your way. Like as not, I am probably better off without you getting in my way."
Yes: (Kirath joins party)
Ileira: Ileira looks about, jubilant. "May the gods be praised! I am Sister Ileira. I journeyed with my comrades into these dungeons to fight evil and bring good. But we were overwhelmed, and most of us were killed..    "I see that because of my faith, I have been given another chance to carry on my mission of good. May I accompany you? My abilities to heal the wounded could be of great help." 
No: "Then I must seek a path of my own. Fare thee well, and may the Light guide you." 
Yes: (Ileria joins party)
Tyrra: Tyrra takes in her surroundings. "Oh, this is just great. I get killed following some fool party down here, and now another party comes by, resurrects me, and wants me to join up! Just like that!.    "What makes you think I wanted to be here in the first place? Sure, I could probably help you; after all, I am a pretty good ranger. But if you're as foolhardy as the last party I followed, you'll need a lot more help than I can give you." 
No: "So you resurrected me just for the fun of it. Sure, go ahead. Go. Fine with me. You do what you want. Me, I'm finding my own way out of here..." 
Yes: (Tyrra joins party)
Tod Uphill: Tod looks about wearily. "I...I'm not quite sure how it is I'm down here. You say I was dead. The last thing I remember was falling down into one of the sewage drains..    "Hey, it's not funny! I am a Serious Adventurer. I have been charged to complete many Important Quests. Perhaps you could find a use for a skilled rogue in your party?"

Otherwise: "Have you reconsidered our offer? Both of our parties would benefit if you assist us." 
Hear Proposal: Armun begins, "Our clan is descended from the dwarves who built these great halls. Here, our ancestors lived in peace, until hordes of evil creatures drove them out and into the realms of men and elves..    "On the surface, our numbers dwindled, finally, our leader, King Teirgoh, gathered our people and led us underground, in search of our ancestral home..    "Using secret knowledge, passed down through the royal family, we finally discovered these stone-carved halls. The halls were vast and we only explored a small portion before we had to made camp in an enclosed area decorated with a stone portal..    "But while the camp slept, the stone portal flared with magical light! From the light, a horde of drow charged us. They were led by a female they called Shindia..    "We rose up and fought the dark ones, though we were exhausted by long weeks of travel. Both sides suffered many casualties, but in the end we forced them to retreat into the portal from which they came..    "The battle was costly. King Teirgoh was wounded by a poisoned dagger, and now lies in eternal sleep. Nothing our cleric can do will wake him. His only son, Prince Keirgar, was captured by the invading drow. With no member of the royal family among us, we no longer have access to their secret knowledge of the exits from these halls..    "Now we wait, while our cleric heals our surviving warriors. Once prepared, we will try to rescue our prince and avenge the fall of Teirgoh. Our numbers are small, but we would rather fight to our deaths than abandon our prince to the drow..    "Unless... If your party were to rescue Prince Keirgar from the drow and return him to us, he could give you information about the exits from these halls. You would have your information and we would have our prince. So, will you help us?" 
Leave: Armun's expression changes from expectant hope to sad disappointment. "It's unfortunate that you can not help us. We wish you well in your travels." 
Help him: Armun accepts your help with gratitude. He hands you a medallion made of stone. "Take this. Shindia dropped it in the battle. It is the key to activate the portal through which she and her minions came..    "Our ancestors built the portals to transport them from one location to another quickly. When the portal doorway is touched with the right object, the portal is activated. We would have followed Shindia and her drow elves back through the portal, but we are not ready to confront them..    "The ancient ones also used powerful magic such as this to gain knowledge. Legend has it that there is an Oracle of Knowledge and the key to its operation is the powerful black orb. By placing an orb into the Oracle, its power is released..    "Our cleric can help heal your wounds. Be careful not to tax him too heavily; he has been healing the wounds of our warriors and trying to revive the king from his poisoned sleep."  (+Item "Rations (+25 food) (6), +Item "Stone Medallion" (#5) Armun stops you. "One other thing: a young dwarven warrior would like to join you in your quest to find the prince.  Will you allow him to join you?" 
No: Dohrum reluctantly remains with his people. 
Yes: Dohrum joins the party (Dohrum joins party)
If you have already spoken to Arhum: I wish you luck in your travels.
If you have "Dwarven Healing Potion":  "This should awaken the king!", you exclaim, as you give the potion to the cleric. Skeptically, the cleric administers the potion. A few moments later, King Teirgoh awakens, still weak but very much alive! .    Quickly, the dwarves explain the past events to King Teirgoh, including your part in awakening him from the coma..     Grateful, the king thanks you. "Brave adventurers, you have saved my life. Please accept this, our most precious gift. I can tell you little about it, save only that it will aid you in your darkest hour."  (+Item: Wand of Slivias)</Note>

You don't realize how many other adventurers have been sent to find the truth about the evils underground. Well, rented redeemers, let me give you the benefit of my vast and profound knowledge..    "Xanathar has been undermining Waterdeep for years. When Waterdeep is sufficiently weakened, he will lead his minions in conquest of the unsuspecting city. The only way to stop Xanathar is to kill him, and that would be virtually impossible without the wand of Silvias..    "As I understand it, the dwarves have the magical artifact, but they do not know what they possess. The drow know that the Wand of Silvias is powerful, but not of its use against Xanathar.  You see the wand is one of the few magic items that can effect a beholder, because it is made from a beholder's eyestalk..    "Stupid drow. They're supposed to be Xanathar's allies, but they plan to finish off the dwarves, steal the wand, and use it to raid the city. This would alert the Lords of Waterdeep to the immensity of the threat from below ground and delay Xanathar's plans of conquest. So, I have to stop the drow and get the Wand of Silvias for myself..    "You see my friends, I have no intention of stopping Xanathar until he has completed the conquest of Waterdeep. After the conquest, Xanathar will be at his weakest. Only then will I strike..    "Xanathar will be at my mercy, and Waterdeep will be mine. So, I certainly can't let you keep Xanathar from conquering Waterdeep. I need only get the Wand of Silvias... and, of course, kill you."

Of course I'm responsible for creating the traps, just as I am responsible for creating the plan that will bring all of Waterdeep under my absolute control!.    "You, of course, cannot be allowed to interfere with my brilliant plan. Surrender to me now, and perhaps I will grant you mercy." 
Surrender: Your vision wavers. A feeling of incredible weakness washes over you. You feel compelled to drop some of your items.  (drop random items)
(Summon "Beholder")
Defeat Beholder: As the party picks through the remains of Xanathar's shattered body, a teleporter triggers about them. As Xanathar's lair fades from view, everyone prepares for battle and thinks, "What now?".    A stately marbled room fades in around the party.  Two stone columns flank a large throne. Sunlight streams in through the windows. Clean air blows in from an open door. This is Piergeiron's public hall! At last, the party is free from the dungeons under Waterdeep!.    "You have killed Xanathar and saved Waterdeep from his evil!" Piergeiron Paladinson exclaims. "We were wise to pick such talented and resourceful adventurers as our agents. For today, let thee be proclaimed the Heroes of Waterdeep and let all know of your brave deeds! Congratulations on your successful quest!"</Note>
